1.1 COMMON EMERGENCIES

### 1.1.1 Anaphylactic Shock

1.1.1  Anaphylactic Shock ICD10 CODE: T78.2

Severe allergic reaction that occurs rapidly (seconds or minutes)  after administration,  or  exposure,  and  may  be  life threatening.  It  generally  affects the  whole  body.

#### Causes

Causes

~ Allergy  to  pollens,  some  medicines  (e.g.,  penicillins,  vaccines, acetylsalicylic acid), or certain foods (e.g. eggs, fish, cow's milk, nuts, some food additives)

~ Reaction to insect bites, e.g., wasps and bees

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

~ Body itching, hives (urticarial rash), swelling of lips, eyes, tongue

~ Difficulty in breathing (stridor, wheezing)

~ Hypotension and sudden collapse, excessive sweating, thin pulse

~ Abdominal cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea.

#### Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis

~ Other causes of shock, e.g., haemorrhagic (due to bleeding), hypovolemic (severe dehydration), septic

~ Asthma, foreign body in airways.

#### Management

### 1.1.2 Hypovolaemic Shock

1.1.2 Hypovolaemic Shock ICD10 CODE: R57.1

Condition  caused  by  severe  acute  loss  of  intravascular  fluids leading to inadequate circulating volume and inadequate perfusion.

#### Prevention

Prevention

~ Always ask about allergies before giving patients new medicine

~ Keep emergency drugs at hand at health facilities and in situatiuons  where  risk  of  anaphlaxis  is  high,  e.g.  visiting bee hives or places that usually harbour snakes

~ Counsel allergic patients to wear alert bracelet or tag.

#### 1.1.2.1 Hypvovolaemic Shock In Children

1.1.2.1 Hypvovolaemic  Shock In Children

Principles  of  management  are  similar  to  the  ones  in  adults BUT:

-Recognising this may be more difficult than in adults

-Vital signs may change little, even when up to 25% of blood volume is lost (class 1 and 2 hypovolaemia)

-Tachycardia is often the first response to hypovolaemia but may also be caused by fear or pain

 Refer urgently for IV treatment

If the child can drink:

 Provide mother with ORS and show her how to give frequent sips during the trip to the referral facility

HC2

If you are able to give IV fluids

 Set up an IV line immediately

If child can drink, give ORS while the drip is set up

 Give 100 ml/kg of Ringer's Lactate

Or  half-strength  Darrow's  solution  in  glucose 2.5% or sodium chloride 0.9%

Divide the IV fluid as follows:

 Reassess patient frequently (every 30-60 minutes) to re-classify dehydration and treatment plan

If the patient is not improving

 Give the IV fluids more rapidly

HC3

As soon as patient can drink, usually after 3-4 hours in infants or 1-2 hours in children

 Also give ORS 5 ml/kg/hour

 Continue to reassess patient frequently; classify degree of dehydration; and select appropriate Plan A, B, or C to continue treatment.

### 1.1.4 Fluids and Electrolytes Imbalances

1.1.4 Fluids and Electrolytes Imbalances ICD10 CODE: E87.8

A condition where losses of bodily fluids from whatever cause has led to significant disturbance in the normal fluid and electrolyte levels needed to maintain physiological functions.

#### Causes

Notes

 Volumes shown are guidelines only. If necessary, volumes can be increased or initial high rate of administration maintained until  clinical  improvement occurs

 In  addition  to ORS ,  other  fluids  such  as  soup,  fruit  juice and safe clean water may be given

-Initially, adults can take up to 750 ml ORS/hour.

 If  sodium lactate compound IV infusion (Ringer's Lactate) is not available, use half-strength Darrow's solution in glucose 2.5%  or  sodium  chloride  infusion  0.9%.  However,  both  of these are less effective

 Continued nutrition is important, and food should be continued during treatment for dehydration.

Caution

 Avoid artificially sweetened juices.

Prevention (for all age groups)

~ Encourage  prompt  use  of  ORS  at  home  if  the  personis vomiting and/or having diarrhoea.

Causes

Disorders may occur in the fluid volume, concentration (sodium composition), and distribution of fluid and other electrolytes and ph. The main cause is problems in intake, loss and/or distribution and balance between water and electrolytes, as shown in the table below:

[/TABLE]



#### Management

Management

IV fluids and electrolytes therapy has three main objectives:

~ Replace lost body fluids and continuing losses

~ Correct eventual imbalances

~ Maintain daily fluid requirements.

Always use an IV drip for patients who are seriously ill (except patients with congestive heart failure; for these, use only an indwelling needle) and may need IV drugs  or surgery. If the fluid is not needed urgently, run it slowly to keep the IV line  open.

Maintenance /uniFB02uid therapy

Notes

 Closely monitor all IV drips to ensure that the rate is adjusted as required

 Check the drip site daily for  any  signs  of  infection;  change drip site every 2-3 days or when the drip goes into  tissues (extravasation).

Diarrhoea and vomiting with severe dehydration, paralytic ileus, intestinal obstruction

 Replace fluid losses with isotonic (sodium) solutions containing potassium e.g. compound sodium lactate infusion (Ringer's Lactate solution)

 Or half-strength Darrow's solution in 2.5% glucose infusion

Haemorrhage

If there is blood loss and the patient is not in shock

 Use sodium chloride 0.9% infusion for blood volume replacement giving 0.5-1 L in the 1st hour and not more than 2-3 L in 4 hours

If there is blood loss >1 litre

 Give  1-2  units  of  blood  to  replace  volume  and concentration

Shock

 Give Ringer's Lactate or sodium chloride 0.9% infusion 20 ml/ kg IV over 60 minutes for initial volume resuscitation

Start rapidly, closely monitor BP

Reduce the rate according to BP response

 In patients with severe shock and significant haemorrhage, give a blood transfusion

Notes

 Closely monitor all IV drips to ensure that the rate is adjusted as required

 Check the drip site daily for any signs of infection; change drip site every 2-3 days or when the drip goes into tissues (extravasation).

[/TABLE]



#### Prevention

Note

 After  dextrose  50%,  flush  the  IV  line  to  avoid  sclerosis  of the vein (dextrose is  very  irritant)

 Preparation of Dextrose 10% from Dextrose 5% and  Dextrose 50%:

-Remove 50 ml from  Dextrose  5%  bottle  and  discard

-Replace with 50 ml of Dextrose 50%. Shake

-Follow normal aseptic techniques

-Use immediately, DO NOT STORE.

Prevention

~ Educate patients at risk of hypoglycaemia on recognition of early symptoms e.g. diabetics, patients who have had a gastrectomy

~ Advise patients at risk to have regular meals and to always have glucose or sugar with them for emergency treatment of hypoglycaemia

~ Advise diabetic patients to carry an identification tag

#### Causes

Causes

~ Animals (e.g. dogs, snakes), humans or insects

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

~ Depend on the cause

#### 1.2.1.1 Snakebites

1.2.1.1  Snakebites

Snakebites can cause both local and systemic effects. Non-venomous snakes cause local effects (swelling, redness, laceration) and venomous snakes cause both local and systemic effects due to envenomation.  Over 70% of snakes in Uganda are non-venomous and most bites are from non-venomous snakes. Of the venomous snakes, more than 50% of bites are 'dry' i.e. no envenomation occurs. In the event that venom is injected, the effect of the venom depends on the type of venom, quantity, location of the bite and size and general condition of the victim.

Cause

~ Common venomous snakes in Uganda: Puff adder, Gaboon viper, black mambas, Brown Forest cobra, Egyptian cobra and Boomslang  (see below images of some of the common snakes in Uganda)

Clinical  features

If cytotoxic venom (Puff adder, Gaboon viper)

~ Extensive local swelling, pain, lymphadenopathy - starting 10-30 minutes after the bite.

[/TABLE]



If neurotoxic venom (Jameson's mamba, Egyptian Cobra, Forest Cobra, Black mamba)

~ Weakness, paralysis, difficulty in breathing, drooping eyelids, difficulty in swallowing, double vision, slurred speech - starting 15-30 minutes after the bite

~ Excessive sweating and salivation

If hemotoxic venom (Boomslang, Vine/Twig snake)

~ Excessive swelling and oozing from the site

~ Skin discoloration

~ Excessive bleeding, bloody blisters

~ Haematuria, haematemesis - even after some days

~ Shock

If combined venom toxicity

~ Late appearance of signs and symptoms

##### Investigations

Investigations

~ Whole blood clotting test at arrival and every   4-6 hours after the first day:

 Put  2-5  ml  of b l o o d       in  a    dry  t u b e   and  observe after  30  minutes

 If   incomplete   or no clotting, it indicates coagulation abnormalities

~ Other useful tests depending on severity, level of care and availability:

 Oxygen Saturation/PR/BP/RR

 Haemoglobin/PCV/Platelet count/PT/APTT/D-Dimer

 Biochemistry for Serum Creatinine/Urea/Potassium

 Urine Tests for Proteinuria/Haemoglobinuria/ Myoglobinuria

 Imaging ECG/X-Ray/Ultrasound

##### Management

Management

#### 1.2.1.4 Rabies Post Exposure Prophylaxis

1.2.1.4  Rabies Post Exposure Prophylaxis ICD10 CODE: Z20.3, Z23

Post exposure prophylaxis effectively prevents the development of rabies after the contact with saliva of infected animals, through bites, scratches, licks on broken skin or mucous membranes. For further details refer to Rabies Post-Exposure Treatment Guidelines, Veterinary Public Health Unit, Community Health Dept, Ministry of Health, September 2001

General management Dealing with the animal

Dealing with the patient

~ The  combination  of  local  wound  treatment  plus  passive immunisation with rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) plus vaccination with rabies vaccine (RV) is recommended for all suspected exposures to rabies

~ if the RI is not available, the patient should still be vaccinated with the Rabies Vaccine alone

~ Since  prolonged  rabies  incubation  periods  are  possible, persons  who  present  for  evaluation  and  treatment  even months after having been bitten should be treated in the same way as if the contact occurred recently

~ Administration of Rabies IG and vaccine depends on the type of exposure and the animal's condition

Administration of Rabies Vaccine (RV)

The following schedules use Purified VERO Cell Culture Rabies Vaccine (PVRV), which contains one intramuscular immunising dose (at least 2.5 IU) in 0.5 ml of reconstituted vaccine.

RV and RIG are both very expensive and should only be used when there is an absolute indication

Post-Exposure Vaccination in Non-Previously Vaccinated Patients

Give RV to all patients unvaccinated against rabies together with local wound treatment. In severe cases, also give rabies immunoglobulin

The 2-1-1 intramuscular regimen

This induces an early antibody response and may be particularly ef- fective when post-exposure treatment does not include administration of rabies immunoglobulins

 Day 0: One dose (0.5 ml) in right arm + one dose in left arm

 Day 7: One dose

 Day 21: One dose

Notes on IM doses

 Doses are given into the deltoid muscle of the arm. In  young children,  the  anterolateral  thigh  may  also  be  used

 Never use the gluteal area (buttock) as  fat  deposits  may interfere with  vaccine  uptake  making  it  less  effective.

Alternative: 2-site intradermal (ID) regimen

 This uses PVRV intradermal (ID) doses of 0.1 ml (i.e. one fifth of the 0.5 ml IM dose of PVRV)

 Day 0: one dose of 0.1 ml in each arm (deltoid)

 Day 3: one dose of 0.1 ml in each arm

 Day 3: one dose of 0.1 ml in each arm

 Day 7: one dose of 0.1 ml in each arm

 Day 28: one dose of 0.1 ml in each arm

Notes on ID regime

 Much cheaper as it requires less  vaccine

 Requires  special  staff  training  in  ID  technique  using  1  ml syringes and short needles

 Compliance with the Day 28 is vital but may be difficult  to achieve

 Patients  must  be  followed  up  for  at  least  6-18  months  to confirm the outcome of treatment

 If  on malaria chemoprophylaxis, do NOT use.

Post-exposure immunisation in previously vaccinated patients

In persons known to have previously received full pre- or post-exposure rabies vaccination within the last 3 years

Intramuscular regimen

 Day 0: One booster dose IM

 Day 3: One booster dose IM

Intradermal regimen

 Day 0: One booster dose ID

 Day 3: One booster dose  ID

Note

 If incompletely vaccinated or immunosuppressed: give full post exposure regimen.

Passive immunisation with rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) Give in all high-risk rabies cases irrespective of the time between exposure and start of treatment BUT within 7 days of /uniFB01rst vaccine.DO NOT USE in patient previously immunised.

Human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG)

 HRIG 20 IU/kg (do not exceed)

-Infiltrate as much as possible of this dose around the wound/s (if  multiple wounds and insufficient quantity, dilute it 2 to 3 fold with normal saline)

-Give the remainder IM into gluteal muscle

-Follow this with a complete course of rabies vaccine

-The first dose of vaccine should be given at the same time as the immunoglobulin, but at a site as far away as possible from the site where the vaccine was injected. If the bite is at or near the upper arm, do not infiltrate the wound with the immunoglobulin unless the vaccine won't be injected in the deltoid muscle of that arm. If the wound near the deltoid is infiltrated with the immunoglobulin, use the deltoid muscle of the opposite arm for the vaccine'.

Notes

 If  RIG  not  available  at  first  visit,  its  administration  can be  delayed up  to  7  days  after  the  first  dose  of  vaccine.

Pre-exposure immunisation

Offer rabies vaccine to persons at high risk of exposure such as:

 Laboratory staff working with rabies virus

 Veterinarians

 Animal handlers

 Zoologists/wildlife officers

 Any other persons considered to be at high risk

 Day 0: One dose IM or ID

 Day 7: One dose IM or ID

 Day 28: One dose IM or ID

1.2.3 Burns ICD10  CODE:  T20-T25

Tissue injury caused by thermal, chemical, electrical, or radiation energy.



[TABLE]
CRITERIA
LEVEL
2nd Degree burns or Partial thickness burns It is a dermal injury that is sub-classified as superficial and deep 2nd degree burns. In su- perficial 2nd degree burns, blisters result, the pink moist wound is painful. A thin eschar is formed. Heals in 10-14 days. In deep 2nd degree burns, blisters are lacking, the wound is pale, moderately painful, a thick escar is formed. Heals in >1 month, requiring surgical debridement
3rd Degree burns Full thickness skin destruction, leather- like rigid eschar. Painless on palpation or pinprick. Requires skin graft. 4th Degree burns Full thickness skin and fascia, muscles, or bone destruction. Lifeless body part
Percentage of total body surface area (TBSA)
Small areas are estimated using the open palm of the patient to represent 1% TBSA. Large areas estimated using the 'rules of nines' or a Lund-Browder chart. Count all areas except the ones with erythema only
The body parts injured
Face, neck, hands, feet, perineum and major joints burns are considered severe
Age/general con- dition
In general, children and the elderly fare worse than young adults and need more care. Aperson who is sick or debilitated at the time of the burn will be more affected than one who is healthy

#### TREATMENT

Management

TREATMENT

LOC

 Switch off electricity

 Cool the burn by pouring or showering or soaking the affected area with cold water for 30 minutes, especially in the first hour after the burn (this may reduce the depth of injury if started immediately)

 Remove soaked clothes, wash off chemicals, remove any constrictive clothing/rings

 Clean the wound with clean water

 Cover the wound with a clean dry cloth and keep the patient with warm

HC1

At health facility

 Give oral or IV analgesics as required

 If TBSA <10% and patient able to drink, give oral fluids otherwise consider IV

 Give TT if not fully immunised

 Leave small blisters alone, drain large blisters and dress if closed dressing method is being used the urine output. The normal urine output is: Children (<30 kg) 1-2 ml/kg/ hour and adults 0.5 ml/kg/hour (30-50 ml /hour)

HC2

 Dress with silver sulphadiazine cream 1%, add saline moistened gauze or paraffin gauze and dry gauze on top to prevent seepage HC3

 Small superficial 2nd degree burns can be dressed directly with paraffin gauze dressing

 Change after 1-3 days then prn

 Patient may be exposed in a bed cradle if there are ex- tensive burns

 Saline bath should be done before wound dressing

TREATMENT

LOC

 If wound infected dress more frequenly with silver sulphad- iazine cream until infection is controlled.

Severe burns

 First aid and wound management as above PLUS

 Give IV fluid replacement in a total volume per 24 hours according to the calculation in the box below (use crystal- loids, i.e., Ringer's lactate, or normal saline)

 If patient in shock, run the IV fluids fast until BP improves (see section 1.1.2)

 Manage pain as necessary

 Refer for admission

 Monitor vital signs and urine output

 Use antibiotics if there are systemic signs of infection: benzylpenicillin 3 MU every 6 hours

+/- gentamicin 5-7 mg/kg IV or IM once a day

 Blood transfusion may be necessary

 If signs/symptoms of inhalation injury, give oxygen and refer for advanced life support (refer to regional level)

Surgery

 Escharotomy and fasciotomy for circumferential finger, hand, limb or torso burns

 Escharectomy to excise dead skin

 Skin grafting to cover clean deep burn wounds

Eye injury

 Irrigate with abundant sterile saline

 Place eye pad over eye ointment and refer

HC3

HC4

H

TREATMENT

LOC

Additional care

 Nutritional support

 Physiotherapy of affected limb

 Counselling and psychosocial support

 Health education on prevention (e.g. epilepsy control)

Caution

 Silver sulphadiazine contraindicated in pregnancy, breast- feeding and premature babies

Fluid replacement in burns

~ The objective is to maintain normal physiology as shown by urine output, vital signs and mental status

~ Fluid is lost from the circulation into the tissues surrounding the burns and some is lost through the wounds, especially in 18-30 hours after the burns

~ Low  intravascular  volume  results  in  tissue  circulatory  in- sufficiency (shock) with results such as kidney failure and deepening of the burns

~ The fluid requirements are often very high and so should be given as necessary to ensure adequate urine output

TREATMENT

LOC

 Give oral fluids (ORS or others) and/or IV fluids e.g. normal saline or Ringer's Lactate depending on the degree of loss of intravascular fluid HC2 HC3

V The total volume of IV solution required in the first 24 hours of the burns is:

4 ml x weight (kg) x % TBSA burned plus  the  normal  daily fluid  requirement

 Give 50% of fluid replacement in the first 8 hours and 50% in the next 16 hours. The fluid input is balanced against

[/TABLE]



#### TREATMENT

TREATMENT

LOC

If wound is clean and fresh (<8 hours)

 Carry out primary closure by suturing under local anaes- thetic

Use lignocaine hydrochloride 2% (dilute to 1% with equal volume of water for injection)

HC3

If wound is >8 hours old or dirty

 Clean thoroughly and dress  daily  f Check the state of the wound for 2-3 days f Carry out delayed primary closure if clean

Use this for wounds up to 2-4 days old

If wound >4 days old or deep pucture wound, contaminated wounds, bite/gunshot wounds, abscess cavity

 Let it heal by secondary closure (granulation tissue)

 Dress daily if contaminated/dirty, every other day if clean

 Pack cavities (e.g. abscesses) with saline-soaked gauzes

In case of extensive/deep wound

 Consider closure with skin graft/flap

Note

~ Use SOP for collection of wound discharge, or deep tissue, submit to lab

~ Start  on  treatment,  change  treatment  when  re- sults return

### 1.2.6 Sexual Assault/Rape

1.2.6 Sexual Assault/Rape ICD10 CODE Z04.4

Rape is typically defined as oral, anal or vaginal penetration that involves threats or force against an unwilling person.

Such penetration, whether wanted or not, is considered statutory rape if victims are younger than the age of consent (18 years).

Sexual assault or any other sexual contact that results from coercion is rape, including seduction of a child through offers of affection or bribes; it also includes being touched, grabbed, kissed or shown genitals.

~ Extragenital injury

~ Genital injury (usually minor, but some vaginal lacerations can be severe)

~ Psychologic symptoms: often the most prominent

-Short term: fear, nightmares, sleep problems, anger, embarrassment

-Long term: Post traumatic Stress Disorder, an anxiety

-disorder; symptoms include re-experiencing (e.g., flashbacks, intrusive  upsetting  thoughts  or  images),  avoidance  (e.g., of  trauma-related  situations,  thoughts,  and  feelings)  and hyperarousal (e.g., sleep difficulties, irritability, concentration problems).

-Symptoms last for >1 month and significantly impair social and occupational functioning.

-Shame, guilt or a combination of both

-Sexually transmitted infections (STIs, e.g., hepatitis, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, trichomoniasis, HIV infection)

~ Pregnancy (may occur)

Note

 Headaches and dizziness following mild traumatic brain  injury may persist for weeks/months

#### Management

Management

Whenever possible, assessment of a rape case should be done by a specially trained provider. Victims are traumatized so should be approached with empathy and respect. Explain and ask consent for every step undertaken.

The goals are:

~ Medical assessment and treatment of injuries

~ Assessment, treatment and prevention of pregnancy and STIs

Collection of forensic evidence

~ Psychologic evaluation and support



[TABLE]
TREATMENT
LOC
- Assailant's use of aggression, threats, weapons - and violent behavior - Description of the assailant - Use of contraceptives (to assess risk of pregnancy), previous coitus (to assess validity of sperm testing) - Clearly describe size, extent, nature of any injury. - If possible take photos of the lesions (with patient's consent)
HC4
 Test for HIV, RPR, hepatitis B and pregnancy, to assess baseline status of the patient - If possible test for flunitrazepam and gamma
hydroxybutyrate ('rape drugs')  Collect forensic evidence (with standard kits if available) - Condition of clothing (e.g., damaged, stained, - adhering foreign material) - Small samples of clothing including an unstained sample, given to the police or laboratory - Hair samples, including loose hairs adhering to - the patient or clothing, semen-encrusted pubic hair, and clipped scalp and pubic hairs of the patient (at least 10 of each for comparison) - Semen taken from the cervix, vagina, rectum, mouth and thighs - Blood taken from the patient - Dried samples of the assailant's blood taken from the patient's body and clothing - Urine, saliva - Smears of buccal mucosa - Fingernail clippings and scrapings - Other specimen as indicated by the history or physical examination

HIV Post Exposure Prophylaxis if within 72 hours:

Adults : TDF+3TC+ATV/r for 28 days

Children: ABC+3TC+LPV/r

 Hepatitis B vaccine if not already immunised

 Emergency contraception if within 72 hours (but may be useful up to 5 days after)

Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg (double the dose if patient is HIV positive on ARVs)

HC4

 Counselling: use common sense measures (e.g., reas- surance, general support, non-judgmental attitude) to relieve strong emotions of guilt or anxiety

 Provide links and referral to:

Long-term psycho-social support

Legal counseling

Police  investigations,  restraining  orders

Child  protection services

Economic empowerment, emergency shelters

Long-term case management

Notes

 Because the full psychologic effects cannot always be ascertained at the first examination, follow-up visits should be scheduled at  2  weeks  intervals

 Reporting: Health facilities should use HMIS 105 to report Gender-Based Violence (GBV)

1.3 POISONING

### 1.3.1 General Management of Poisoning

1.3.1 General Management of Poisoning ICD10 CODE: T36-T50

Bodily entry of toxic substances in amounts that cause dysfunction of body systems.

Principles of general management

 If possible, refer patients showing signs of poisoning to hospital for admission. Send a note of what is known about the poison and what treatment has been given

 Also refer/admit  patients who have taken slow-acting poisons even if they appear well. These include: acetylsalicylic acid, iron, par- acetamol, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine), paraquat, modified-release products

 Optimal management of the poisoned patient depends upon the specific poison(s) involved, the presenting and predicted severity of illness and time that has elapsed between exposure and presentation

 Treatment includes supportive care, decontamination, antidotal therapy and enhanced elimination techniques

 It may not always be possible to identify the poison and the amount taken. Anyway,

 Only a few poisons have specific antidotes

 Few patients need active removal of the poison

 Most patients must be treated symptomatically

However, knowledge of the poison will help you anticipate the likely effects on the patient.

Supportive Treatment in Poisoning



[TABLE]

Other considerations  Counsel patient and families concerning poisoning  A psychiatric evaluation is necessary if poisoning was intentional  If environmental or ccupational exposure, follow up to assess if other people have been affected and take appropriate measures
HC4
[/TABLE]



Removal from the stomach

~ Balance the dangers of attempting to empty the stomach against the likely toxicity of any swallowed poison as determined by the type of poison and amount swallowed against the risk of inhalation

~ Do not induce vomiting

~ Gastric lavage

 Only  useful  if  done  within  2  hours  of  poisoning  (except with  salicylates or  anticholinergics  when  it  may  be  of  use within  4  to  6  hours)

 Seldom practicable or necessary before  the  patient reaches hospital

 Contraindications:  drowsy  or  comatose  patients  and  if poisoning  with corrosive or  petroleum  products

Prevention of absorption and active elimination

~ Oral activated charcoal can bind many poisons in the stomach and reduce their absorption

~ It is more effective the sooner it is given but may still work up to 2 hours after poisoning (longer with modified-release products and anticholinergics)

~ Contraindications

-Depressed mental status

-Late presentation

-Ingestion of corrosives and petroleum products

-Toxins  poorly  absorbed  by  charcoal  (e.g.  metals  like  iron, lithium, alcohol)

-Intestinal obstruction

~ It  is  generally  safe  and  especially  useful  for  poisons  toxic  i n small amounts, e.g. antidepressants

### Prevention

Prevention

~ Heat cooked foods thoroughly before eating and avoid  eating cold left-over cooked foods

~ Ensure adequate personal and domestic hygiene

1.4 HYPOXEAMIA MANAGEMENT AND OXYGEN THERAPY GUIDELINES

Hypoxaemia is the low concentration of Oxygen in blood or oxygen saturation (SpO2) less than 90% in peripheral arterial blood detected on pulse oximeter reading. Hypoxaemia is a life-threatening condition correlated with disease severity and an emergency stat. Left untreated and for prolonged periods of time, it results into low tissue oxygen concentration (Hypoxia), and this leads to death.

### Causes

Causes

~ Surgical causes.

-Head Injury, Chest trauma

~ Medical Causes

-Severe Asthma, Pneumonia, Sepsis, Shock, Malaria, Covid-19, Heart Failure, Cardiac arrest, Upper airway obstruction, Severe anaemia, Pertussis, Carbon Monoxide poisoning.

~ Obstetric, gynaecological, and perioperative causes.

-Obstructed labour, Ruptured uterus, Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, Post caesarean section,

~ Neonatal causes

-Transient tachypnoea of the new-born, Hypoxic Ischaemic encephalopathy (Birth asphyxia), Respiratory distress Syndrome, Neonatal Septicaemia.

### Diagnosis

Diagnosis

 Do a clinical assessment (history taking for symptoms and physical examination for signs)

 Pulse oximetry and blood gas analysis. The findings on clinical assessment (symptoms and signs) [It is non-invasive but associated with missed opportunities for diagnosis].

### Symptoms

Symptoms

 Fast/very slow breathing, Difficulty in breathing,

 Inability to talk, complete sentences

 Extreme weakness

 Inability to feed

 Confusion, sleepy, agitated

 Convulsions

### Clinical Features

Clinical Features

Fast breathing rate for age (Tachypnoea)

Note: bpm = Breaths per minute

 Nasal flaring

 Head nodding

 Chest in drawing (Intercostal, subcostal recession)

 Cyanosis (peripheral or central)

 Prostration

 Glasgow coma scale< 10/15

 Use of any accessory muscles of respiration

### Management

Management

~ Pulse oximetry use. Always refer to the manufacturer's in- sert or the steps outlined below for guidance on how to use the pulse oximetera.

~ The steps involved in conducting pulse-oximetry

 Turn on the Pulse oximeter.

 Attach the Oximeter probe to the finger or toe.

 Wait until there is a consistent pulse -wave signal before you take the reading, this may take 20-30 seconds.

 Record the reading and act accordingly.

~ Interpreting pulse-oximetry results

 SpO2 > 90% without danger signs = Normal

 SpO2 < 90% =Low oxygen concentration in blood (Hypoxaemia)

 SpO2 <92- 95% in Pregnancy = Low oxygen concentration in blood (Hypoxaemia)

 SpO2 < 94 % with danger signs = Low oxygen concentration in blood (Hypoxaemia

Blood gas analysis-direct measurement of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) and Carbon dioxide (PC02) 2, the PH and electrolytes concentration in blood. It is the most accurate, but it is highly skill dependant, expensive and invasive.

### Treatment

Treatment

Oxygen therapy

The treatment of hypoxaemia includes the use of Medical Oxygen (Oxygen therapy) and specifically treating the underlying cause.

Indications

~ All patients with documented Hypoxaemia-arterial Carbondioxide tension (Paco2) of < 60 mmHg or peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) OF < 90%.

~ Patients with the following danger/emergency signs irrespective of the documented SpO2, PaCO2.

~ Absent or obstructed breathing, Features of severe respiratory  distress,  Central  cyanosis,  Convulsions,  Signs  of shock, Coma

~ All acute conditions in which Coma is suspected like:

~ Acute  Asthma,  Severe  Trauma,  Acute  myocardial  Infarction, Carbon monoxide poisoning

~ Post anaesthesia recovery.

~ Increased metabolic demand

~ Severe  burns,  Poisoning,  Multiple  injuries,  Severe  infections

Medical Oxygen dosing and appropriate use of delivery device.

~ The dosing of oxygen is dependent on the age of the patient and severity of disease while the choice of appropriate delivery devices depends on the amount or dose of oxygen to be delivered to a patient.

Titrate oxygen based on oxygen saturation and delivery device.

~ Weaning patient off oxygen

 The oxygen flowrate/ dose should be decreased if patient stabilizes or improves with SpO2 above 90%.

 Decrease oxygen flow by 1-2Litre/min once patient is stable with Oxygen saturation above 92%.

 Observe the patient for 2-3 minutes, reassess after 15 mins to en- sure Sp02 is still above 90% (by recording clinical exam and SpO2)

 If a patient does not tolerate less oxygen, then maintain the flow rate that the patient has been on prior to reducing until the patient is stable (Sp02 >92%)

 If a patient is in increased respiratory distress or Sp02 less than 90%, then increased the oxygen flow rate to the previous rate until the patient is stable.

 If a patient remains stable after 15 mins of reassessment and Sp02 >92%, continue to titrate oxygen down as tolerated.

Recheck clinical status and Sp02 on the patient after 1 hour for delayed hypoxemia or respiratory distress.

2.1 BACTERIAL INFECTIONS

### 2.1.1 Anthrax

2.1.1 Anthrax ICD10 CODE: A22.10-A22.9

Anthrax is an acute zoonotic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. It most commonly occurs in wild and domestic animals, such as cattle, sheep, goats, camels, antelopes, and other herbivores. B. anthracis spores can live in the soil for many years.

It occurs in humans when they are exposed to infected animals or tissue from infected animals. The incubation period is usually 1-3 days. Anthrax is a notifiable disease.

Cause

~ Exposure  to  B.  anthracis  spores  by  handling  products from infected animals or by inhaling anthrax spores from contaminated animal products

~ Anthrax can also be spread by eating undercooked meat from infected animals

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

Symptoms vary depending on how the disease was contracted, and usually occur within 7 days

#### Investigations

Investigations

¾ Isolation of Bacillus anthracis from blood, skin lesions, or respiratory secretions- Smear-many bacilli

¾ Or measure specific antibodies in the blood of persons with suspected infection



[TABLE]

### 2.1.2 Brucellosis

2.1.2 Brucellosis ICD11CODE: A23.9

(Undulant fever, malta fever, abortus fever)

A zoonotic bacterial infection of acute onset. Common as an occupational

disease among people working with infected livestock or associated fresh animal products, for example butchers, farmers, abattoir workers, and vendors of contaminated roasted meat (muchomo). Incubation is 2-4 weeks on average, but it can be from 1 to 8 weeks.

#### Management

Management

#### TREATMENT

TREATMENT

LOC

Cutaneous anthrax

 Treat for 7-10 days

 First line is ciprofloxacin 500 mg every 12 hours

 Alternatives: doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours

 Or amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours

HC2

#### Prevention

Prevention

The following public measures are key for quick prevention and control of anthrax infection:

~ Health education and information

~ Proper disposal by burying of carcasses, hides and skins; (no burning as it can spread spores)

~ No skinning of dead animals; this allows spore formation, which can stay in soil for decades

~ No eating of meat from dead animals

~ Restrict movement of animals and animal by-products from infected to non-infected areas

~ Mass vaccination of animals in endemic areas

~ Vaccination using human anthrax vaccine for:

-Persons  who  work  directly  with  the  organism  in  the laboratory

-Persons who handle potentially  infected  animal  products

-in high-incidence areas

#### Causes

Causes

~ Brucella abortus (cattle)

~ Brucella canis (dog)

~ Brucella melitensis (goats and sheep)

~ Brucella suis (pigs)

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

~ Intermittent (fluctuating) fever

~ Aches and pains

~ Orchitis (inflammation of the testes)

~ Vertebrae osteomyelitis (uncommon but characteristic)

#### Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis

~ T yphoid fever, malaria, tuberculosis

~ Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness)

~ Other causes of prolonged fever

#### Investigations

Investigations

¾ Blood: complement fixation test or agglutination test (where possible)

The interpretation of serological tests can be difficult, particularly  in endemic  areas  where  a  high  proportion  of the  population  has  antibodies against  brucellosis.  Positive serological  test  results  can  persist  long  after recovery  in treated  individuals  so  results  have  to  be  interpreted  on  the basis of  the  clinical  picture.

Isolation of the infectious agent from blood, bone marrow, or other tissues by culture

Management

Prevention

~ Provide public health education on

-Drinking only pasteurised or boiled milk

-Careful handling of pigs, goats, dogs, and cattle if a person has wounds or cuts

-Provide veterinary services for domestic animals

Case de/uniFB01nition

A case of leprosy is a person with clinical signs of leprosy who requires chemotherapy.

Diagnosis of leprosy

Diagnosis of Leprosy must be based on careful clinical examination of the patient and when necessary, backed by bacteriological examination

Leprosy is diagnosed by finding at least one of the three cardinal signs:

-Hypopigmented  patches  with  definite  loss  of  sensation  in them

-Thickened  or  enlarged  peripheral  nerves,  with  loss  of sensation and/or weakness of the muscles supplied by those nerves

-The presence of acid-fast bacilli in a slit skin smear

Classi/uniFB01cation of leprosy

Paucibacillary (PB) leprosy - 1-5 patches

Multibacillary (MB) Leprosy - More than 5 patches

#### Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis

~ Hypopigmentation e.g. birthmark, early vitiligo

~ Fungal infections of the skin

~ Molluscum contagiosum

~ Other  nodular  conditions,  e.g.  Kaposi's  sar c o m a ,  neurofibromatosis, secondary  syphilis

~ Other  causes  of  peripheral  nerve  damage,  e.g.  diabetes mellitus

~ Psoriasis, molluscum contagiosum

#### Investigations

Investigations

¾ In  most  cases,  a  definite  diagnosis  of  leprosy  can  be made using clinical signs alone

¾ At referral centre: stain slit  skin  smears for Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB)

¾ Skin biopsies NOT recommended as a routine procedure

Management

Multi-drug therapy (MDT) for leprosy is presented in the form of various monthly dose blister packs. The same three drugs are used  for both PB leprosy and MB leprosy, with special packs for children

Summary of Treatment of leprosy

Recommended treatment (drugs and their doses)

Steroids for treatment of severe leprae reactions

 Prednisolone 40 mg once daily in morning

-Treat for 12 weeks in PB and 24 weeks in MB

-Reduce dose gradually by 10-5 mg once every 2 weeks (PB) or 3 weeks (MB)

Note

 In patients co-infected with HIV and  on cotrimoxazole , do not use dapsone.

 Health  worker  should  directly  observe  that  the  medicines taken once a month are actually swallowed

 Treatment durations longer than 12 months and steroids for leprae  reactions  should  only  be  prescribed  by  specialists  at referral centres

 Lepra reactions: sudden inflammation (pain, redness, swelling, new lesions, loss of nerve function) in skin lesions or nerves of a person with leprosy. They can occur before, during or after MDT completion.

 Presence of residual signs or post-treatment reactions is NOT an indication to re-start the treatment

 Refer to the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Programme (NTLP) manual 2016 for more details

Prevention

~ Early diagnosis of cases and effective treatment

~ Screening of contacts of known patients

~ Administration  of  Single  dose  rifampicine  in  contacts  of leprosy  patients  to  prevent  contacts  of    leprosy  patients from developing leprosy disease

~ Rifampicine dose used in contacts of leprosy patiients

~ BCG vaccination may be help

Disability due to Leprosy

Leprosy commonly causes physical disabilities which generate social stigma.  Disability refers to an impairment (primary or secondary) that makes it difficult or impossible for the affected person to carry out certain activities, e.g. affecting manual dexterity, personal care, mobility and communication behavior

De/uniFB01nitions of disability:

In the hands and feet:

Grade 0 = No anesthesia, no visible deformity or damage

Grade 1 = Anaesthesia, but no visible deformity or damage

Grade 2 = Visible deformity or damage present In the eyes

Grade 0 = no eye problem due to leprosy, no evidence of visual loss

Grade 1 = eye problem due to presence of leprosy, but vision not severy affected as a result (6/60 or better, can count fingers at six meters)

Grade 2 = s evere visual impairment (vision worse than 6/60; inability to count fingers at six meters), lagophthalmos, iridocyclitis, corneal opacities

Management of Disability in the hand and feet

Resting of the affected limb in the acute phase can be aided by splinting, especially at night

~ Soaking and oiling for about 30 minutes every day of dry skin helps to prevent cracking and preserves the integrity of the epidermis.

~ Use of a clean dry cloth to cover the wounds and walking as little  as  possible  and walk slowly, taking frequent rest. Passive exercise and stretching to avoid contractures and strengthen muscle weakness

~ Use of a rough stone to smoothen the skin on the feet or palms,

~ Protective foot wear (MCR Sandals) al, the time. For insensitive feet and protective appliances like gloves for insensitive hands

Eye complications due to Leprosy

These include

Lagophthalmos: whole spectrum

2 .Corneal hypoesthesia: with/without corneal ulcers

Acute iritis and scleriti

4.Chronic iritis and iris atrophy

### 2.3.5 Rabies

2.3.5 Rabies ICD10 CODE: A82

Rabies is a viral infection of wild and domestic animals, transmitted to humans by saliva of infected animals through bites, scratches or licks on broken skin or mucuos membranes. Once symptoms develop, rabies presents as a fatal encephalitis: there is no cure and treatment is palliative.

Before symptomatic disease has developed, rabies can effectively be prevented by post-exposure prophylaxis.

Cause

~ Rabies virus. Incubation is average 20-90 days but can be

shorter in severe exposure (multiple bites, bites on face/ neck) of even longer (> a year) in a few cases

#### Prevention

Prevention

~ Isolate patient for nursing and treatment, applying contact and droplets precautions

~ Immunise all children below 5 years from the area of the suspected case

~ If case is confirmed, organize mass immunisation campaign

~ Proper disposal of children's faeces

~ Immunisation (see chapter 18)

~ Proper hygiene and sanitation

##### Management

Management

Safety of health workers: maximum level of infection control procedures

Health workers should maintain a high level of suspicion for Ebola virus disease. While standard precautions should be followed for all patients at all times, implementation of transmission-based precautions for cases suspected or confirmed to have Ebola or Marburg virus diseases is essential. This includes: screening for rapid identification and isolation of cases,

##### Prevention

 Hand hygiene according to the WHO 5 moments safe injection practices use of personal protective equipment (e.g. eye protection, mask (medical or respirator), gloves, gown or coverall, head covering, apron and gum (rubber) boots.

 Handling and disposing of all waste related to the care of an Ebola patients as infectious

 Safe handling and disinfection of linens (or disposal if not possible) and thorough cleaning and disinfection of the environment and medical equipment.

 Disinfectants (e.g. chlorine mixture of 0.5% for surfaces) used must be prepared and used ensuring adequate concentration and contact time on surfaces.

 Handling of the deceased is particularly high risk and should be kept to a minimum. Strict adherence to IPC measures including hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (e.g. eye protection, mask (medical or respirator), gloves, gown or coverall, head covering, apron and gum (rubber) boots is required.

Patient care

Refer to the MoH recent guidelines for management of viral hemorrrhagic fevers

 Optimised   Supportive treatment of signs and symptoms

 Replace and monitor fluids and electrolytes for patients with diarrhoea or vomiting

Triage and contact tracing

 Triage patient (those who had contact with a patient or not)

 Contact identification, contact listing and contact follow up

Dead Body handling

 Avoid washing or touching the dead f There should be no gathering at funerals. The dead should be buried promptly by a designated burial team

Prevention

~ Health education of the population (e.g. avoid eating w i l d  animals)

#### 2.5.2.1 Uncomplicated Malaria

Cause

 There  are  five  Plasmodium  species  of  malaria  parasit es which infect humans namely: P . falciparum, P . vivax, P . ovale, P . malariae and P . knowlesi.

 P. falciparum is the most virulent and also the most  common malaria parasite in Uganda.

Clinical Features of Malaria

 It may be asymptomatic, mild illness (uncomplicated malaria) or severe illness (severe malaria)

 Intermittent fever is the most characteristic symptom of malaria. Three classical stages can be distinguished in a typical attack of malaria:

 The cold stage: the patient feels cold and shivers

 The hot stage: the patient feels hot

 The  sweating  stage:  associated  with  sweating  and  relief  of symptoms.

 A complete physical  examination has  to  be  performed  i n   any patient presenting with fever  or  history  of  fever.

 When people are frequently exposed to malaria, they  develop partial immunity. In such people, the classical stages of a malaria attack  above  may  not  be  observed.

 Also, in people who have had partial treatment with antimalarial medicines,  these  classical  stages  may  not  be pronounced.

2.5.2.1 Uncomplicated Malaria ICD 10 CODE: B50.9

Common symptoms/signs of uncomplicated malaria

~ Fever: above 37.5°C (taken from the axilla ) or history of fever.

~ Loss of appetite, mild vomiting, diarrhoea

~ Weakness, headache, joint and muscle pain

~ Mild  anaemia  (mild  pallor  of  palms  and  mucous  membranes); occurs commonly in children.

~ Mild dehydration

#### 2.5.2.2 Complicated/Severe Malaria

~ Enlarged spleen (in acute malaria it may be minimally enlarged, soft and mildly tender)

2.5.2.2 Complicated/Severe Malaria ICD10 CODE: B50.0, B50.8

It is an immediate threat to life and is therefore a medical emergency. Malaria is regarded as severe if there are asexual forms of P . falciparum in blood plus one or more of the following complications in the table below.

Investigations for Malaria

Note: All suspected malaria patients MUST be tested by blood slide or RDT before they are treated. NOT all fevers are malaria.

 RDT or thick blood slide for diagnosis of malaria

 Random blood sugar and Hb level if clinically indicated

 Lumbar puncture: in case of convulsion/coma and negative malaria test

¾ Thin film for parasite identification

Note on RDTs

 RDTs (Rapid Diagnostic tests) detect malaria antigen (not whole parasites  like  the  blood  slide)  and  remain  positive  for 2  to  3 weeks after effective treatment

 RDT do not become negative if the patient has already  taken antimalarials

 RDTs are reliable, quick and easily accessible tools for  malaria diagnosis.

A blood slide for microscopy is specifically recommended over RDT in the following situations:

¾ Patients  who  have  completed  antimalarial  treatment  and symptoms persist

¾ Patients who completed treatment but comes back within 3 weeks

¾ RDT negative patients without any other evident cause of fever

Management of severe malaria

General principles

Manage complications as recommended in the section below

Manage fluids very carefully. Adults with severe malaria are very vunerable to fluid overload, while children are more likely to be dehydrated

Monitor vitals signs carefully, including urine output.

Intravenous artesunate is the medicine of choice

-At a health unit without admission and IV drug administration facilities,  give  a  pre-referral  dose  of  rectal  artesunate* only recommended for children of 6 years and below( see dosing tables  below)  as  soon  as  possible  and  refer  for  further management

-At a health unit with admission and IV drug administration facilities, treat with IV artesunate as in the table below

-If IV route is not possible, use IM route.

-If Iv artesunate is  not available, use IM artemether (into the thigh, never in the buttock) or IV quinine

##### TREATMENT

TREATMENT

Haemoglo- bi- nuria (intravas- cular haemol- ysis)

 Rehydrate the patient

 Assess for anaemia and transfuse if necessary

Dehydration

 Rehydrate using ORS or IV RL or NS (see rehydration, section 1.1.3)

 Over-enthusiasitc IV infusion may harm the patient and lead to fluid overlaod and pulmo- nary oedema

Bleeding

 Transfuse patient with whole fresh blood to provide lacking clotting factors

Coma

 Check and treat for hypoglycaemia: if not re- sponding within 20 min, consider another cause

 f Provide intensive nursing care with:

IV drip (for rehydration and IV medication)

NGT (for feeding and oral

medication)

Urethral catheter (to monitor urine output)

Turning  of  patient  frequently  to  avoid bed sores

Criteria for referral to regional/tertiary hospital

~ Persistent renal failure needing dialysis

~ Any complication that cannot be managed locally

Management of RDT/Blood Smear Negative Ptients

Patients who have a negative malaria test (most likely, if RDT is used) do not have malaria so other causes of fever have to be investigated for appropriate treatment.

~ Re-assess patient history, clinical signs and laboratory re- sults. Consider other frequent causes of fever such as:

 If running nose, sore throat and cough: viral upper respiratory infection

 If swollen tonsils with exudate on it: tonsilitis

 If ear pain and discharge: otitis

 If cough, rapid breathing and difficulty in breathing: pneumonia

 If urinary symptoms: urinary tract infection

 If vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain: gastro-enteritis

 If skin rash: measles or other viral rash

~ If  malaria  is  still  suspected,  investigate  according  to  the flowchart below

 If signs/symptoms of severe malaria, RDT and blood slide negative but no other diagnosis is found, consider treating for malaria any- way but repeat RDTs after 24 hours to confirm.Also add a broad spectrum antibiotic

 If RDT and blood slide negative, no signs of other illness and no signs of severe sickness (patient has no danger signs) treat symp- tomatically with antipyretics, advise patient to return immediately if condition worsens or in 2 days if fever persists.

Possible reasons for false negative tests (test is negative but patient has malaria):

~ Low peripheral parasitaemia

~ Technical error in performing the test or test reagents that are out of date

~ Sequestration of parasites in the internal organs

~ Having  already  taken  antimalarial  drugs,  inadequate  or incomplete dose: this affects only microscopy, while RDT remains positive even if the patient has already taken an antimalarial using prophylactic treatment for malaria

#### 2.5.3.4 Malaria Prophylaxis

Patient with negative

blood smear or RDT

Is there evidence of

non-malarial illness?

Treat non-malarial

illness

Are there signs and

symptoms suggestive

of severe malaria?

Treat for severe disease with artesunate and broad- spectrum antibiotics. Repeat testing (RDT) in 12-24 hours

Withhold treatment for malaria, give

symptomatic treatment and ask the

patient to come back immediately

if the illness becomes worse or if it

persists for more than two days.

### 2.5.4 Human African Trypanosomiasis (Sleeping Sickness)

Reduce human-mosquito contact

~ Use insecticide-treated materials (e.g. bed nets)

~ Destroy  adult  mosquitoes  by  indoor  residual  spraying  of dwellings with insecticide or use of knock-down sprays

~ Screen houses

~ Carefully select house sites avoiding mosquito-infested areas

~ Wear clothes which cover the arms and legs and use repellent mosquito coils and creams/sprays on the skin when sitting outdoors at night

Control mosquito breeding sites

~ Eliminate  collections  of  stagnant  water  where  mosquitoes breed,  e.g.  in  empty  cans/  containers,  potholes,  old  car tyres, plastic bags, and footprints by disposal, draining, or covering with soil or sand

~ History of blood transfusion between 1975 and 1986

3.1.1 Clinical Features of HIV

The WHO Clinical Staging of HIV for adults and children in the tables below shows the typical clinical features of HIV infection. The staging is based on demonstration of one or more opportunistic infections or key findings and correlates with disease progression and prognosis. Clinical staging should be performed at HIV diagnosis, on entry into HIV care, at ART initiation and at every visit hereafter to help guide patient care and monitor disease progress.

WHO Staging for HIV Infection and Disease in Adults and Adolescents

### 3.1.2 Diagnosis and Investigations of HIV

3.1.2 Diagnosis and Investigations of HIV

HIV testing is the point of entry into comprehensive care HIV services. The aim of HIV testing services (HTS) is to promptly identify HIV status to ensure early linkage to prevention, treatment, and support services. Early diagnosis is fundamental for early treatment, good prognosis and reduction in transmission. HTS should be availed to all persons at risk of HIV infection using cost-effective and high-impact approaches. HTS should be differentiated to subpopulations and geographical locations because less than 20% of PLHIV aged 15 years and above do not know their status. Uganda is currently implementing targeted HIV testing to optimize HIV case identification and linkage to care. People at high risk of HIV acquisition include: being in a sexual relationship with multiple concurrent partners; belonging to a key, vulnerable or priority population (e.g., children, adolescent girls and young women, pregnant or breastfeeding women); being a sexual contact to an index client; being a biological child to an HIV positive client; not knowing your partner's HIV status; or being in a serodiscordant relationship.

The following approaches are utilized in targeted HIV testing.

Screening for HIV testing eligibility for children, adolescents and adults

Index client testing (ICT), including Assisted Partner notification (APN) and testing for biological children/ Know Your Child Status (KYCS).

Social Network Strategy (SNS)

HIV Self-Testing (HIVST)

Pre and post counselling and consent are needed except in the following situations:



Diagnostic testing: test carried out on very sick,

unconscious, symptomatic or mentall ill by attending health care team for the purpose of better patient management

 Routine testing: for individuals likely to pose a risk of HIV infection to others e.g. pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, sexual offenders and survivors, blood or body tissue or organ donors. Individuals tested using this appraoch must be given an opportunity to know their status

If a patient is positive, he/she must be IMMEDIATELY connected to HIV care services.

In adults and children >18 months, testing is based on serological (antibody) testing.

Due to the window period between infection and production of detectable levels of antibodies, patients who are negative should be re-tested after three months if they had a possible exposure in the 3 months before the test.

HIV/Syphilis Duo Test

Serological testing is available from HC2 level.

In children below 18 months, testing is virological, that is based on direct detection of viral DNA (DNA-PCR).

Virological testing (DNA-PCR and viral load) is done on DBS (dried blood spots) samples which can be collected from HC2 and are sent to a central national laboratory through the hub system.

HIV testing in children less than 18 months

The recommended test for children <18 months is virological (DNA-PCR) testing, since antibody tests will detect antibodies passed to the child from the mother (so the test can give a false positive).

If the mother is HIV negative:

f The child is classified as HIV negative

If the mother is positive:

 Do DNA PCR at 6 weeks of age or at an earlier opportunity thereafter

 Start cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and Niverapine syrup till HIV status is confirmed for the child

 If PCR is positive, enroll child for ART

 If PCR is negative and child never breasted the  child is negative.

 Stop cotrimoxazole and Niverapine.

 Follow up every 3 months and do HIV rapid test (serological) at 18 months.

 If PCR is negative BUT child is breastfeeding/has breasfed in the last 6 weeks, re-check PCR 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding.

If mother's status is unknown:

 Test the mother and continue management according to the result

If mother unavailable:

 Perform rapid antibody testing on the child. The result will give indication on the mother's status:

-If the test is negative: child negative

-If the test is positive, follow algorithm for managing a child from a HIV positive mother.



[TABLE]
TEST
DESCRIPTION
LOC
CD4
It measures the level of CD4 T lym- phocytes, a subtype white blood cell. It reflects the level of compromise of the immune system. It is used for initial as- sessment pre ART and for monitoring of ART effect.
HC2
Viral Load
It measures the quantity of virus in the blood. It is used to monitor the effect of ARVs. It is currently done by DBS (Dried Blood Spot)
HC2
Genotype Testing
HIV genotypic resistance test is a quali- tative test that detects mutations associ- ated with ARV drug resistance. The test evaluates if the HIV strain infecting the individual has developed resistance to one or more ARV drugs. This is useful in identifying a combination of ARVs to which the HIV strain is susceptible

### 3.1.3 Measures before ARV Treatment

3.1.3 Measures before ARV Treatment

Even without the use of specific ARV treatment, there are many ways in which good HIV management can help patients:



[TABLE]
TREATMENT
LOC
Prophylaxis against opportunistic infections The following groups have been prioritized for cotrimox- azole preventive therapy: • All PLHIV newly initiating on ART. • Those having a current WHO stage 3 or 4 event or other symptoms of advanced disease. • Pregnant and breast-feeding women. Note: Additional intermittent preventive treatment for malaria using Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP) is not required for pregnant women on CPT. • Children and adolescents aged 0-15 years. Patients suspected to have treatment failure  Cotrimoxazole 960 mg once daily for adults and children >30 kg Child <5 kg: 120 mg once daily Child 5-14.9 kg: 240 mg once daily Child 15-29.9 kg: 480 mg once daily  Contraindications: known allergies, severe anaemia and neutropenia Guidance for when to stop CPT in stable PLHIV • Patient should be older than 15 years of age. • Patient should not be pregnant.
HC2
[/TABLE]





[TABLE]
TREATMENT
LOC
• Patient should have been on ART for at least one year. • Patient's last VL should be suppressed. • Patient should not have a current WHOstage 3 or 4 event or other symptoms of advanced HIV disease at the time of stopping CPT. When to re-start CPT in PLHIV CPT can be restarted in the following scenarios: • New pregnancy • Suspected treatment failure • New Treatment WHO stage 3 or 4 condition Alternative: dapsone Adults and child >12 years: dapsone 100 mg daily Children below 12 years: dapsone 2 mg/kg daily
HC2
TPT (TB Preventive treatment)  such as; isoniazid + rifapentine(3HP) weekly for 3 months in all adults, adolescents and children >12 months living with HIV and in whom TB disease has been excluded (other medications for TPT refer to the current HIV/TB guidelines)  If child <12 months, give only if history of contact with TB case and no active disease (one-month daily rifap- entine and isoniazid (1HP).) - Dose: (see section 5.3.2.1 )
HC3
Prompt and appropriate medical care By treating opportunistic infections as they occur By treating symptoms, such as pain, diarrhoea, and skin problems, as they develop Going for treatment promptly if unwell
HC3
[/TABLE]



Positive health, dignity, and prevention intervention



[TABLE]
Intervention
Description
Preventing HIV trans- mission
PLHIV should be encouraged to adopt safer sexual practices includ- ing abstinence, correct and con- sistent condom use. Condom use prevents HIV transmission, reduces risk of other STIs, and prevents unintended pregnancies.
Disclosure and partner testing
PLHIV should actively explore ways of disclosing their HIV status to sexual partners, family members and significant others. Offer provid- er- and/or counselor-mediated or supported disclosure as options for those who do not feel comfortable disclosing on their own.
Family planning
Encourage PLHIV to discuss their reproductive choices and support them to adopt those which do not compromise their health. For women who choose to conceive, link them to eMTCT services.
Alcohol and other risk reduction
Educate on risks of alcohol abuse leading to poor treatment adherence resulting in disease progression, and the likelihood of engaging in risky sexual behaviours, placing themselves at increased risk for acquiring STIs and placing their negative partners at risk for infection.

### 3.1.4 General Principles of Antiretroviral Treatment (ART)

3.1.4 General Principles of Antiretroviral Treatment (ART)

Assessment of patient's history

~ Level of understanding of HIV/AIDS

~ Length of time since the diagnosis of HIV infection

~ Demographics and lifestyle: whether employed and nature of work

~ History of previous ART

~ Pregnancy risks: contraception options and choices, current or planned pregnancy, access to contraceptive services

~ Sexual risks and disclosure: willingness to practice safer sex, disclosure of HIV serostatus, use of condoms, HIV counsel- ling, and testing of sex partners and children

~ Symptoms of chronic pain and depression

~ History of opportunistic infections and other significant ill- nesses e.g. TB and STIs, hospitalisations, and surgeries

~ Current  medications  (including  anti-TB  drugs,  traditional therapies, etc.)

Physical exam

~ Weight

~ Nutritional status

~ Functional capacity and level of disability

~ Vital  signs,  skin,  eyes,  oropharynx  (presence  of  thrush), lymph nodes, lungs, heart, abdomen, genital tract (STIs), ex- tremities, nervous system

Baseline  laboratory  tests  to  assess  immunosuppression  and  disease aggressiveness

~ Confirming HIV serostatus

~ CD4 testing

~ Pregnancy test

~ Full  blood  count  particularly  for  patients  starting  on  a AZT-containing regimen

Baseline Labs to assess general health and diagnose any pre-existing HIV complications

~ Sputum smear for AFB for patients who have coughed for > 2-3 weeks and a chest X-ray for patients who have unproductive cough or whose AFB smears are negative

~ Urine analysis for proteinuria, particularly for patients starting on TDF-containing regimen

~ Syphilis  and  Hepatitis B screening

~ Liver and renal function tests if available

~ Cryptococcal antigen and urine LAM screening for patients whose CD4 count is < 200 cells/ml

~ Symptom-directed lab tests to diagnose pre-existing illnesses

Staging of disease

~ Using WHO clinical criteria  (see  tables  above)  Counselling and assessment of patient's readiness to start therapy

~ Assess  for  education,  information  or  counselling  support needs

~ Develop an adherence plan

Goals of treatment with antiretroviral medicines are to:

~ Inhibit viral replication as reflected in plasma HIV concentration to as low as possible and for as long as possible. This promotes restoration of the immune system.

~ Preserve  or  enhance  the  immune  function  (CD4  restoration),  which  prevents/delays  the  clinical  progression  of HIV disease

~ Minimise  toxicities  and  side  effects  associated  with  the medicines

~ Improve quality of life and reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality

~ Promote growth and neurological development in children

Tools to achieve the goals of therapy

~ Maximisation of adherence to ART: adequate support to pa- tient to adhere to treatment and/or access to community/ facility level adherence counselling

~ - Disclosure of HIV serostatus reinforces patient's adherence to ART

~ Rational  sequencing  of  medicines  to  preserve  future  treat- ment options

~ Use of ARV medicine resistance testing when appropriate and available

~ Use of viral load estimates for monitoring

Principles of ART

~ Antiretroviral therapy is part of comprehensive HIV care. The guiding principles of good ART include:

~ Efficacy and durability of the chosen medicine regimens

~ Freedom from serious adverse effects; low toxicity

~ Ease of administration including no food restrictions, better palatability, and lower pill burden

~ Affordability and availability of medicines and medicine com- binations

~ Organised sequencing - spares other available formulations for  use  in  second  line  while  allowing  for  harmonisation of regimens across age and population

~ Ongoing support of the patient to maintain adherence

Limitations of ART

~ Antiretroviral medicines are not a cure for HIV but greatly improve quality of life when used appropriately

~ ARVs  are  relatively  expensive,  require  an  adequate  infrastructure, and knowledgeable healthcare workers

~ Medicine interactions and resistance may decrease the potency of ARVs

~ Patients may develop adverse medicine reactions

~ Patients have to take at least 95% of their pills in order to respond well (adherence is key to successful therapy)

~ The medications have to be taken for life

~ Some patients may not respond (benefit) to treatment and continue to regress in spite of high adherence

~ Children are dependent on adults for adherence to ART

Available Medicines for ART

At present, antiretroviral medicines come in six classes, which attack different sites and stages of the HIV life cycle, thereby interfering with its reproduction.



[TABLE]
CLASS
EXAMPLES
Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhib- itors (NtRTIs) incorporate themselves into the DNA of the virus, thereby stopping the building process
Tenofovir (TDF) Zidovu- dine (AZT) Lamivudine (3TC) Abacavir (ABC
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) stop HIV production by binding directly onto the reverse transcriptase enzyme, and prevent the con- version of RNA to DNA
Efavirenz (EFV) Nevi- rapine (NVP) Etravirine (ETV)
[/TABLE]



Initiation of ART

It is recommended to initiate ART at the earliest opportunity in all do umented HIV-infected adults, adolescents and children regardless of CD4 count and WHO clinical staging (Test and Treat)

Evidence and programmatic experience have shown that early initiation of ART results in reduced mortality, morbidity and HIV transmission outcomes. However, priority should be given to patients with lower CD4 counts as well as those who are symptomatic.



[TABLE]
CLASS
EXAMPLES
Integrase inhibitors interfere with the HIV DNA's ability to insert itself into the hostDNA and copy itself.
Dolutegravir (DTG) Raltegravir (RAL)
Protease inhibitors (PIs) prevent HIV from being successfully assembled and released from the infected CD4 cell. Boosted PIs are combinations of low-dose ritonavir (RTV) with a PI for pharmacoenhancement
Atazanavir (ATV) Lopinavir (LPV) Darun- avir (DRV) Ritonavir (RTV, abbre- viated as 'r' if boosting other PIs, e.g. ATV/r, LPV/r
Entry inhibitors (HIV fusion inhibitors) prevent the HIV virus particle from infecting the CD4 cell
Enfuvirtide (T-20)
CCR5 antagonists block the CCR5 co-re- ceptor molecules that HIV uses to infect new target T-cells. Some forms of HIV use a different co- receptor and thus, some patients may not benefit from maraviroc
Maraviroc
[/TABLE]



A CD4 count is not necessary for initiation but should be used to identify patients with advanced HIV disease.

ART in children

The vast majority (about 90%) of infants and children with HIV acquire the infection through mother-to-child transmission.

HIV infection follows a more aggressive course among infants and children than among adults; 30% die by age 1 year and 50% die by age 2 years without access to life-saving medicines, including ART and preventive interventions, such as cotrimoxazole prophylaxis.

Early HIV diagnosis and ARV treatment is critical for infants. A significant number of lives can be saved by initiating ART for HIV-positive infants immediately after diagnosis within the first 12 weeks of life.

General principles

~ ARV doses need to be adjusted from time to time as the chil - dren grow quickly and thus, their weight changes.

~ Before a child begins ART, the following assessments must be made:

 Readiness of parents/caretakers or child (if older) to start ART

 Complete pre-treatment baseline assessment (see previous sections) Process of initiating ART

Health workers should do the following before initiating ART:

Assess all clients for any evidence of opportunistic infections (OIs). If the patient has TB or cryptococcal meningitis, ART should be deferred and initiated after starting treatment of these OIs.

For patients without TB or cryptococcal meningitis, offer ART on the same day through an opt-out approach. In this approach, patients should be prepared and assessed for readiness to start ART on the same day.

If a client is ready, ART should be initiated on the same day. If a client is not ready or opts out of same-day initiation, a timely ART preparation plan should be agreed upon with the aim of initiating ART within seven days for children and pregnant women, and within one month for adults.

3.1.5 Recommended First Line Regimens in Adults, Adolescents, Pregnant Women and Children

HIV management guidelines are constantly being updated according to evidence and public policy decisions. Always refer to the latest official guidelines.

The 2022 guidelines recommend DOLUTEGRAVIR (DTG)  an integrase inhibitor as the anchor ARV in the preferred first and second-line treatment regimens for all HIV infected clients; children, adolescents, men, women (including pregnant women, breastfeeding women, adolescent girls and women of child bearing potential).

ART regimens in children are age and weight dependent. When children grow, doses and regimens have to be changed according to the guidelines below.

### 3.1.6 Monitoring of ART

3.1.6 Monitoring of ART

The purpose of monitoring patients on ART is to assess:

~ Response to ART and early detection of treatment failure

~ Side effects and toxicity

~ Adherence

The schedule of monitoring visits follow a pre-set calendar for the 1st one year after initiation of ART, i.e:

 At 1, 2 and 3 months from start of ART

 At 6, 9, 12 months

After 12 months from initiation of ART, the Differentiated Model of Care Delivery is followed, in which schedule and modalities of periodic checks are based on individual needs and characteristics of the patient. The aim of this model is:

 A client centered approach, so that stable patients have spaced checks and fast tracks drug pick ups

 More efficient use of resources by avoiding overcrowding and long waiting times

 More focus on unstable/complex patients

(Refer to MOH HIV/ART guidelines for more details).

### 3.1.7 ARV Toxicity

3.1.7 ARV Toxicity

ARV drugs can cause a wide range of toxicities, from mild to life threatening. Active monitoring and management of toxicities and side effects is important not only to avoid negative medical outcome but also to ensure that they do not negatively affect adherence.



[TABLE]
CATEGORY
ACTION
Severe Life- Threatening Reactions (e.g. SJS/TEN, severe hepatitis
Immediately discontinue all ARV drugs (possibly all drugs in general), manage the medical event and substitute the offending drug when the patient is stabilised
Severe Reactions (e.g. Hepatitis, anae- mia)
Stop the offending drug and substitute it without stopping the ART (if clinically possible)
Moderate Reactionsy (Gynaecomastia, lipo- dystrophy)
Substitute with a drug in the same ARV class but with a different toxicity profile, or with a drug in a different class Do not discontinue ART. Continuation of ART as long as feasible. If the patient does not improve on symptomatic thera- py, consider single- drug substitution
Mild Reactions (Head- ache, minor rash, nau- sea)
Do not discontinue or substitute ART. Reassure the patient or caregiver that while the reaction may be bothersome, it does not require a change in therapy and often it subsides in few weeks.
Provide support to mitigate the adverse reactions as well as counseling about the events

### 3.1.8 Recommended Second Line Regimens

3.1.8 Recommended Second Line Regimens in Adults, Adolescents, Pregnant Women and Children

Patients may need to be switched to second line regimens   in case of treatment failure, and to third line if they fail on second line drugs. Third line regimens require resistancetesting to inform the choice of appropriate drugs, and needs referral to specialised ART centres.

Factors involved in treatment failure are poor adherence, inadequate drug levels or prior existing drug resistance.

Before switching therapy, it is essential to assess and address adherence issues, and provide intensive adherence counselling if necessary.

Criteria for defining treatment failure are presented in the following table:

[TABLE]
DEFINITION
COMMENT
VIROLOGICAL FAILURE Two consecutive viral loads >1000 copies/ml, done at three to six months apart, with intensive adherence support following the 1st VL test
Patient should have been on ART for at least six months
CLINICAL FAILURE Adults and adolescents: New or recurrent WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 (with exception of TB) in a patient who has been on ef- fective ART regimen for at least six months Children : New or recurrent WHO clinical stage 3 or stage 4 event (with the exception of TB) in a patient who has been on effective ART regimen for at least six months
The condi- tion must be differentiated from Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) occurring after initiating ART

· All PLHIV should receive resistance testing to inform the prescription of 2ndand 3rd-line medicines.

· Since all 3rd-line PLHIV will have prior PI Exposure, DRV/r will be taken twice a day.

For recipients of care on  NNRTI-based First Line regimen whose VL is not suppressed, switch

-

without a second VL but conduct IAC to improve adherence to new regimen.

For all PLHIV failing first-line ART, optimize the second-line ART using HIVDR test

### 3.1.9 Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV

For children≥10kg that are able to swallow tablets, give LPV/r 100/25mg tablet.

tablets of LPV/r 100/25mg can be substituted with 1 tablet of LPV/r 200/50mg in order to reduce the pill burden. These tablets should be administered fully intact/whole i.e. not cut or crushed.

DRV must be administered with 0.5mL of RTV 80mg/mL oral suspension in children <15kg, with 2 tab of RTV 25mg in children 15 to 25kg and 3 tab of RTV 25mg in children above 25kg. DRV is always taken with food.

DRV 600mg must be co-administered with RTV 100mg.

3.1.9 Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV

Approximately one-third of the women who are infected with HIV can pass it to their babies.

Cause

Time of transmission

~ During pregnancy (15-20%)

~ During time of labour and delivery (60%-70%)

~ After delivery through breast feeding (15%-20%)

Pre-disposing factors

~ High maternal viral load

~ Depleted maternal immunity (e.g. very low CD4 count)

~ Prolonged rupture of membranes

~ Intra-partum  haemorrhage  and  invasive  obstetrical  procedures

~ If delivering twins, first twin is at higher risk of infection than second twin

~ Premature baby is at higher risk than term baby

~ Mixed feeding carries a higher risk than exclusive breastfeeding or use of replacement feeding

#### Investigations

Investigations

 Blood: HIV serological test

 HIV DNA PCR testing of babies (see algorithm in section 3.1.2 above)

 Viral load testing every 6 months

Management

All HIV services for pregnant mothers are offered in the MCH clinic. After delivery, mother and baby will remain in the MCH postnatal clinic till HIV status of the child is confirmed, then they will be transferred to the general ART clinic.

The current policy aims at elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission (eMTCT) through provision of a continuum of care with the following elements:

-Primary HIV prevention for men, women and adolescents

-Prevention of unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV

-Prevention of HIV transmission from women living with HIV to their infants

-Provision  of  treatment,  care  and  support  to  ALL  women infected with HIV, their children and their families

ART
o All women/girls living with HIV identified during pregnancy, labour and delivery or while breastfeeding should be started on lifelong ART o ART should be initiated on the same day, and adherence counseling should be initi- ated and sustained intensively for the first three months then maintained for life. o Initiate mother on once-daily FDC of TD- F+3TC+DTG with pharmacovigilance o The mothers initiated on TDF + 3TC +EFV400 shall be transitioned to TDF + 3TC + DTG at 6-9 months post-partum if VL within past 6 months is suppressed. o If mother is already on ART >6 months with TDF/3TC/EFV, do VL test. If she is virally suppressed, maintain her on TDF/3TC/EFV400 until 6-9 months after delivery and then substitute EFV with DTG if VL within the past 6 months is sup- pressed. o If she is already on a DTG-based 1st-line regimen and virally suppressed, maintain on the same regimen. o If she is already on ART and VL is not suppressed, manage as treatment failure and switch to DTG-based 2nd line regimen (if no previous exposure to DTG).

Description
ART
o If she is on 2ndline ART with ATV/r or LPV/r and virally suppressed, maintain on the same regimen until 6-9 months after delivery and then substitute PI with DTG if VL within the past 6 months is suppressed and no previous exposure to DTG. o All women should receive Pre-ART adher- ence counseling before initiating ART and ongoing adherence support after that o ART should be initiated and maintained in mother-baby care point in MCH.
What to do if mum refuses ART or if you know adherence is poor: Maternal VL suppression is key for prevent- ing breastfeeding transmission, so if VL suppression is not certain infant prophy- laxis may serve as a 'back up' to prevent MTCT - similar to 'Option A'. Clinical providers should continue infant prophy- laxis with NVP for these specific scenari- os. Continuation of prophylaxis should be seen as an interim measure while maternal adherence is improved
Risk reduction coun- seling and support
•Encourage consistent and correct condom use •Encourage women to deliver at the health facilities •For negative pregnant women, offer other prevention services like SMC to partner and mitigate or manage GBV

Description
Identification of HIV-exposed in- fants
• Identify all HIV-exposed infants; document the HIV status of the mother in the child card and mothers' passport. Infants whose HIV status is not documented or is unknown should be offered rapid HIV testing; including those whose mothers did not receive eMTCT services or have become newly infected after pregnancy. Rapid diagnostic tests for HIV serology can be used to assess HIV exposure among infants younger than four months of age. HIV-exposure status among infants and children 4-18 months of age should therefore be ascertained by HIV serolog- ical testing the mother. The mother should be tested every 3 months until end of breastfeeding. The entry points for identification of HIV-ex- posed infants include YCC, OPD pediatric/ Nutrition/TB wards and outreaches. Special at- tention should be paid during immunization both at static and outreach areas to ensure that all children have their exposure status ascertained.

DESCRIPTION
Routine immuni- zation
• HIV-infected children are more susceptible to diseases preventable by immunization than their HIV-uninfected counterparts. • HIV-infected infants and children can safely receive most childhood vaccines if given at the right time. All HIV-infected and exposed chil- dren should be immunized as per EPI immuni- zation schedule. • Health workers should review child immuniza- tion status at every visit • Some special considerations/modifications for HIV-exposed children: o BCG: When considering BCG vaccination at a later age (re-vaccination for no scar or missed earlier vaccination), exclude symptomatic HIV infection. Children with symptomatic HIV infec- tion should not receive BCG. o Measles: Although the measles vaccine is a live vaccine, it should be given at six and nine months even when the child has symptoms of HIV. The measles illness from the vaccine is milder than that from the wild measles virus, which is more severe and likely to cause death. o Yellow Fever: Do not give yellow fever vaccine to symptomatic HIV-infected children; asympto- matic children in endemic areas should receive the vaccine at nine months of age

DESCRIPTION
Growth moni- toring and nu- tritional assess- ment
 Growth and child nutrition should be monitored using weight, length/height, and MUAC at all encounters with a child, and recorded on the growth monitoring card  MUAC should only be measured starting at six months of age.  Failure to gain weight or height, slow weight or height gain, and loss of weight may be an indication of HIV infection in an infant/young child. Failure to thrive affects as many as 50% of HIV-infected infants and children. HIV-infected infants and children who are failing to thrive have a significantly increased risk of mortality.  Counsel the mother/caregiver on the child's growth trend and take appropriate action where necessary.
Development monitoring
 At each visit assess the infant's age-specific developmental milestones.  Infants are at high risk for HIV encephalopathy and severe neurologic disease  Early identification of developmental delay can facilitate intervention and these children can improve with treatment.  • Some forms of development delay are:  The child may reach some developmental milestones but not others.  The child may reach some milestones but lose them after some time.  The child may fail to reach any developmental milestones at all.  Test children with developmental delay for HIV and, if infected, initiate on ART.  Measure the infant's head circumference.

[TABLE]
SERVICE
DESCRIPTION
Early Childhood Development
 The first two years of life are the most critical for brain development and influences during this period significantly contribute to longer-term developmental outcomes.  ECD therefore comprises all the essential care and support a young child needs to survive and thrive in life and spans the period from prenatal to eight years of age across multiple domains consisting of physical, cognitive, language and communication, social and emotional and spiritual development. Years 0-8 most critical stage of life because the brain undergoes most dramatic growth  It is well established that infants and young children exposed or affected by HIV have poorer health and developmental outcomes compared to their non-HIV affected peers. Prevention of mother- to-child transmission (PMTCT) services, which focus on mothers and infants throughout the exposure period provide an ideal platform during a period of life that affects both longer-term health and developmental potential, moreover, the services along the PMTCT cascade are well aligned with intervention points for ECD.  ECD services and messages will therefore be well integrated into PMTCT/HEI services to improve outcomes of HEI.

What to do if baby presents after 6 weeks: a. Do first PCR b. Give ART (First Line Paed regimen; give weight appropriate dose) for 6weeks c. If PCR results are negative, give NVP for 6 weeks (after completing the 6 weeks of ART) d. If PCR results are positive, continue with ART first line ART. Irrespective of timing, the mother should be started on ART as soon as possible for her own health and to decrease risk of transmission to breastfeeding baby.

Opportunistic infection proph- ylaxis
Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis Cotrimoxazole (CTX) prophylaxis significantly re- duces the incidence and severity of Pneumocystis Jiroveci pneumonia. It also offers protection against common bacterial infections, Toxoplas- mosis and Malaria. • Provide CTX prophylaxis to all HIV-exposed infants from six weeks of age until they are prov- en to be uninfected. • Infants who become HIV-infected should con- tinue to receive CTX prophylaxis for life. • If CTX is contraindicated, offer Dapsone at dose of 2mg/kg once daily (up to 100mg). TB Preventive Treatment (TPT) • Give INH for six months to HEI who are ex- posed to TB after excluding TB disease. • For newborn infants, if the mother has TB disease and has been on anti-TB drugs for at least two weeks before delivery, INH prophylaxis should not be given. Malaria prevention: • All HEI and HIV-infected children should receive insecticide treated nets and CTX. Using both reduces risk of malaria by 97%.
Actively look for and treat infections early
HEI are susceptible to common infections and OIs. • Counsel caregivers to seek care to receive timely treatment.
[/TABLE]

[TABLE]
SERVICE
DESCRIPTION
• At every visit, assess HEI for signs and symp- toms of common childhood illnesses using the Integrated Maternal, New-born and Childhood Illnesses Guidelines and provide treatment.
Counseling and feeding advice
Provide infant feeding counseling and advice according to guidance.
Educate the caregiver and family
• HEI depend on their caregivers to receive care. • Provide information to the caregivers and family about the care plan including what to expect and how to provide care for the infant. • Caregivers should participate in making decisions and planning care for the child, including decisions about therapy and where the child should receive care. • Empower caregivers to be partners with the health facility. • Provide key aspects of home-based care for the child, including: o Dispensing prophylaxis and treatment o Maintaining adherence o Complying with the follow-up schedule o Ensuring good personal and food hygiene to pre - vent common infections o Seeking prompt treatment for any infections or other health-related problem
The most important thing for the child is to have a healthy mother. Ensure the mother/infected caregiver is receiving their care. If the mother is sick, the infant will not receive care.

#### 3.1.9.3 Care of HIV Exposed Infant

3.1.9.3 Care of HIV Exposed Infant

HIV-exposed infants should receive care at the mother-baby care point together with their mothers until they are 18 months of age. The goals of HIV-exposed infant care services are:

~ To prevent the infant from being HIV infected

~ Among those who get infected: to diagnose HIV infection early and treat

~ Offer child survival interventions to prevent early death from preventable childhood illnesses

The HIV Exposed Infant and the mother should consistently visit the health facility at least nine times during that period.

The visits are synchronised with the child's immunisation schedule (i.e., at 6, 10 and 14 weeks, then at 5, 6, 9, 12, 15 and

18 months).

Immunisation

 Immunise HIV exposed children as per national immu- nisation schedule

 In case of missed BCG at birth, do not give if child has symptomatic HIV

 Avoid yellow fever vaccine in symptomatic HIV

 Measles vaccine can be given even in symptomatic HIV

Counselling on infant feeding choice

-Explain the risks of HIV transmission by breastfeeding (15%) and other risks of not breastfeeding (malnutrition, diarrhoea)

-Mixed feeding may also increase risk of HIV transmission

-and diarrhoea

-Tell her about options for feeding, advantages, and risks

-Help her to assess choices, decide on the best option, and then support her choice

-Feeding options

-Recommended option: Exclusive breastfeeding then complementary feeding after child is six  months old

-Exclusive breastfeeding stopping at 3-6 months old if

-replacement feeding possible after this

-If  replacement  feeding  introduced  early,  mother  must  stop breastfeeding

-Replacement feeding with home-prepared formula or commercial formula and then family foods (provided this is acceptable, feasible, safe, and sustainable/ affordable)

If mother chooses breastfeeding

-The  risk  may  be  reduced  by  keeping  the  breasts  healthy (mastitis and cracked nipples raise HIV infection risk)

-Advise exclusive breastfeeding for 3-6 months

#### 3.1.10.1 Tuberculosis and HIV Co-Infection

3.1.10.1  Tuberculosis and HIV Co-Infection

Active TB may be present when ART needs to be initiated or it may develop during treatment.

TB and HIV care for co-infected patients should be provided in an integrated manner under one roof by one care team (one-stop-shop).

Co-management of TB and HIV is complicated by:

~ Drug interactions between rifampicin and both the NNRTI and PI classes

~ Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)

~ Pill burden, overlapping toxicities and adherence issues.

##### Management

If mother chooses replacement feeding

 Counsel and teach her on safe preparation, hygiene, amounts, times to feed the baby etc.

 Follow up within a week from birth and at any visit to health facility.

Management

ART should be initiated in all TB/HIV co-infected people irrespective of their clinical stage or CD4 count. However, the timing of initiation of treatment may differ based on whether the patient is diagnosed with TB before or after initiating ART.

#### 3.1.10.2 Cryptococcal Meningitis

Rifampicin to Rifabutin (if available) is ideal

TB prevention

~ BCG  immunisation:  it  protects  children  against  severe forms of TB. It can be given at birth. If delayed, avoid in symptomatic HIV

~ IPT (Isoniazid Preventive Treatment) (see section 5.3.2.3)

3.1.10.2 Cryptococcal Meningitis ICD10 CODE: B45

Crytococcal meningitis is an opportunistic  infection  caused by a fungus Cryptococcus neoformans.

~ In Uganda, cryptococcal meningitis (CM) associated mortality is up to 39%. Patients with a CD4 cell count of <100 are at the highest risk, so early screening and management is critical.

~ Screening In ART-Naive Patients

~ Screen routinely for Cryptococcal Meningitis with the cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) test (a bedside finger prick test):

-All ART naive individuals with CD4 <100 cells/µL

-Patients on ART with viral load (VL >1000 copies/ml) or clinical (stage 3 or 4 disease) failure

~ If  serum CrAg negative and no signs of meningitis: start ART immediately (or switch regimen)

~ If  CrAg positive and/or signs or symptoms of meningitis (headache,  presence  of  seizures,  altered  consciousness, photophobia, neck stiffness, and a positive Kernigs' sign)

-Perform lumbar puncture and test for CSF CrAg (culture if possible)

~ If CSF CrAg positive, diagnose and treat for Cryptococcal Meningitis

~ If  CSF  CrAg  negative  but  blood  CrAg  positive,  give  pre emptive treatment for asymptomatic cryptococcal disease or non CNS cryptococcal disease

Adequate control of elevated CSF pressure
• Control of increased intracranial pressure improves survival by 25% in persons with Cryptococcal Meningitis. • All patients with a CSF Pressure >250mm H2O will need a therapeutic LP the following day to reduce the CSF pressure to <200 mm. • In the absence of a manometer, one may use an IV giving set to create an improvised manometer measuring the height with a meter stick. Removing 20-30mL of CSF (even in the absence of a manometer) may be adequate to decrease CSF pressure. Most patients

#### 3.1.10.3 Hepatitis B and HIV Co-Infection

3.1.10.3 Hepatitis B and HIV Co-Infection ICD10 CODE: B18

~ Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease among HIV patients. In Uganda, the prevalence of Hepatitis B among HIV patients is estimated to be at 17%. (see section 6.5.2 for more details on hepatitis B infection)

~ All HIV-infected patients initiating and those failing ART should be routinely screened for HBV infection using Hep B surface Antigen (HBsAg)

~ People living with HIV with a positive HBsAg should have other complementary tests at baseline and repeated every 6 months and these include:

 A complete blood count

 Liver function tests: ALT, AST, albumin, bilirubin, PT-INR

 Liver ultrasound scan: to assess stage of liver fibrosis

~ Repeat tests every 6 months since patients with chronic HBV infection are at increased risk for hepatocellular car- cinoma

Management of HBV/HIV co-infection

The goal of HBV/HIV treatment is to prevent dual disease progression and to reduce HBV-related morbidity and mortality

3.1.11.1 Post-Exposure Prophylaxis ICD10 CODE: Z20.6

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the short-term use of ARVs to reduce the likelihood of acquiring HIV infection after potential occupational or non-occupational exposure.

Types of Exposure

~ Occupational exposures: Occur in health care settings and include sharps and needlestick injuries or splashes of body fluids to the skin and mucous membranes

~ Non-occupational exposures: Include unprotected sex, exposure  following  assault  like  in  rape  &  defilement,  road traffic accidents and injuries at construction sites where exposure to body fluids occur

Steps in providing PEP

Step 2: Eligibility assessment

Provide PEP when:

-Exposure occurred within the past 72 hours; and

-The exposed individual is not infected with HIV; and

-The 'source' is HIV-infected or has unknown HIV status or high risk

Do not provide PEP when:

-The exposed individual is already HIV positive;

-When  the  source  is established  to  be  HIV negative;

#### 3.1.11.2 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)

3.1.11.2 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)

Oral Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)

Definition: PrEP is the use of ARV drugs by HIV uninfected persons to prevent the acquisition of HIV before exposure to HIV. Table below describes processes involved in offering PrEP.

The process of providing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)

[TABLE]
Process
Description
Screening for risk of HIV
PrEP provides an effective additional biomedical prevention option for HIV-negative people at substantial risk of acquiring HIV infection. These include people who: a) Live in discordant sexual relationships b) Have had unprotected vaginal sexual intercourse with more than one partner of unknown HIV status in the past six months c) Have had anal sexual intercourse in the past six months d) Have had sex in exchange for money, goods or a service in the last six months e) Use or abuse of drugs especially injectable drugs in the last six months f) Have had more than one episode of a STI within the last twelve months g) Are part of a discordant couple, especially if the HIV-positive partner is not on ART or has been on ART for less than six months or not virally suppressed. h) Recurrent post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) users. (Re- current implies PEP use more than 3 times a years). i) Are members of key or priority populations who are unable or unwilling to achieve consistent use of condoms.
[/TABLE]

[TABLE]
Process
Description
NB: Eligibility is likely to be more prevalent in populations such as discordant couple, sex workers, fisher folk, long-distance truck drivers, men who have sex with men (MSM), uniformed forces, and adolescents and young women including pregnant and lactatingAGYW at substantial risk.
Screening for PrEP eligibility
After meeting the substantial risk for HIV criteria:  Confirm HIV-negative status using the national HTS algorithm  Rule out signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection  Assess for hepatitis B infection: if negative, patient is eligible for PrEP; if positive, refer patient for Hepatitis B management. Note:  HEP B positive test is not a contraindication for initiating PrEP, however precaution
needs to be taken when making a decision to stop PrEP to avoid HEP B viral load flare.  Creatinine test and creatinine clearance calculation using GFR formula is done. Do not offer PrEP if Creatinine clearance is less than 1.2mg/dl. Note: Absence of this should not delay PrEP initiation in persons with no signs and symptoms of renal impairment. If available, creatinine test can be done at initiation and repeated every 6 months. I. Assess for contraindications to TDF/FTC or TDF/3TC.
[/TABLE]

[TABLE]
Process
Description
Steps to initiation of PrEP
Provide risk-reduction and PrEP medication adherence counseling: II. Provide condoms and education on their use III. Initiate a medication adherence plan IV. Prescribe a once-daily pill of TDF (300mg) and FTC (200mg) or TDF (300mg)/ 3TC (300mg) V. Initially, provide a 1-month TDF/FTC or TDF/3TC prescription (1 tablet orally, daily) together with a 1-month follow-up date
Follow-up/ mon- itoring clients
VII. After the initial visit, the patient should be given a two- month follow-up appointment and thereafter quarterly appointments
on PrEP
VIII.Perform an HIV antibody test using the national HTS algorithm and every three months. Note: Blood based HIVST is an alternative for PrEP refill in case of absence of the national HTS standard recommended in patients on PrEP. IX. For women, perform a pregnancy test if there is history of amenorrhea. X. Review the patient's understanding of PrEP, any barriers to adherence, tolerance to the medication as well as any side effects. XI. Review the patient's risk exposure profile and perform risk-reduction counseling. XII. Evaluate and support PrEP adherence at each clinic visit. XIII.Evaluate the patient for any symptoms of STIs at every visit and treat according to current STI treatment Guide- lines.
[/TABLE]

The PrEP Ring

The PrEP ring is a long-acting HIV prevention method developed specifically for clients who are unable or do not want to take oral PrEP or when oral PrEP is not available. The ring is made of a flexible silicone material containing 25 mg of an ARV drug called dapivirine. It is inserted into the vagina and should remain in place for one month. Dapivirine belongs to a class of ARVs called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) that reduce the ability of HIV to replicate itself inside a healthy cell. The ring delivers the drug directly to the site of potential infection over the course of one month, with low absorption elsewhere in the body, lowering the likelihood of systemic side effects.

[TABLE]
Process
Description
Guidance on dis- continuing PrEP
• Acquisition of HIV infection • Suspected signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection following a recent exposure within 4 weeks • Changed life situations resulting in lowered risk of HIV acquisition (no longer at substantial risk of HIV acquisition) • Intolerable toxicities and side effects of ARVs • Chronic non-adherence to the prescribed regimen despite efforts to improve daily pill-taking. • Personal choice • HIV-negative in a sero-discordant relationship when the positive partner on ART for >6months has achieved sustained viral load suppression (condoms should still be used consistently). The HIV negative partner can be allowed to continue PrEP even if the positive partner
For detailed guidance on the provision of PrEP, please refer to the Technical Guidance on Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for Persons at High Risk of HIV in Uganda, 2022.
[/TABLE]

Possible Side Effects of the PrEP Ring

Possible side effects of the ring are typically mild and include urinary tract infections (UTIs - experienced by about 15% of users), vaginal discharge (experienced by about 7% of users), vulvar itching (experienced by about 6% of users), and pelvic and lower abdominal pain (experienced by about 6% of users).

Contraindications for PrEP Ring Use

The ring should not be provided to people with:

 An HIV-positive test result according to the national HIV testing algorithm

 Known exposure to HIV in the past 72 hours (because such clients may derive more benefit from post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) if the potential for HIV exposure was high)

 Signs of AHI (Box 1) AND potential exposure within the past 14 days

 Inability  to  commit  to  effectively  using  the  ring  and  attend scheduled follow-up visits

3.1.12 Psychosocial Support for HIV-Positive Persons

HIV-positive persons benefit greatly from the following support after the first impact of the test result is overcome:

~ Provide of emotional support

~ Help the person understand the social, medical, and psychological implications for him/herself, the unborn child (in the case of a pregnant woman), and any sexual partners

~ Connect the person with support services, including (religious) support groups, orphan care, income- generating activities, home care and others

~ Help the person find strategies to involve his/her partner and extended family in sharing responsibility

~ Help the person identify someone from the community to support and care for him/her

~ Discuss with HIV positive mothers how to provide for the other children in the family

~ Help him/her identify a person from the extended family or community who will provide support

~ As appropriate, confirm and support information given in HIV counselling and testing on mother-to-child transmission, possibility of ARV treatment, safer sex, infant feeding and FP advice

~ Help the person to understand and develop strategies to apply new information within daily life.

3.2 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STI)

STIs  are  a  collection  of  disorders,  several  of  which  are  better regarded as syndromes for more effective management using a syndromic approach.

Prevention of STIs

~ General preventive measures include:

~ Give health education about STIs

~ Provide specific education on the need for early reporting and compliance with treatment

~ Ensure notification and treatment of sexual partners

~ Counsel patient on risk reduction e.g. practice of safe sex by using condoms, remaining faithful to one sexual partner, personal hygiene

~ Provide condoms

~ If necessary and possible, schedule return visits

### 3.2.1 Urethral Discharge Syndrome (Male)

3.2.1 Urethral Discharge Syndrome (Male)

ICD10 CODE: R36

It  refers  to  urethral  discharge  in  men  with  or  without  dysuria, caused by a number of diseases usually spread by sexual intercourse, which produce similar manifestations in males and may be difficult to distinguish clinically.

#### Causes

Causes

~ Common: Neisseria gonorrhoea (causing gonorrhoea),

~ Chlamydia trachomatis and Ureaplasma urealyticum

~ Uncommon: Trichomonas vaginalis

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

~ Mucus or pus at the tip of the penis; staining underwear

~ Burning pain on passing urine (dysuria), frequent urition

### 3.2.2 Abnormal Vaginal Discharge Syndrome

3.2.2 Abnormal Vaginal Discharge Syndrome

ICD10 CODE: N76

Often the first evidence of genital infection al, though absence of abnormal vaginal discharge does not mean absence of infection. Normal discharge is small in quantity and white to colourless. Not all vaginal infections are sexually transmitted diseases.

#### Causes

Causes

~ Can be a variety and often mixture of organisms

~ Vaginitis:  by  Candida  albicanis,  Trichomonas vaginalis or bacterial  vaginosis  (by  Gardnerella  vaginalis,  Mycoplasma hominis)

~ Cervicitis:  commonly  due  to  gonorrhoea  and  chlamydia: usually asymptomatic and rarely a cause of abnormal vaginal discharge.

~ Clinical features

~ Increased quantity of discharge, abnormal colour and odour

~ Lower  abdominal  pain,  itching  and  pain  at  sexual  intercourse may be present

~ In  Candida  albicans  vaginitis:  very  itchy  thick  or  lumpy white discharge, red inflamed vulva

~ Trichomonas  vaginalis:  itchy  greenish-yellow  frothy  discharge with offensive smell

~ Bacterial vaginosis: thin discharge with a fishy smell from the vagina

#### Differential diagnosis

Candida vaginitis and bacterial vaginosis are NOT sexually transmitted diseases, even though sexual activity is a risk factor.

~ Gonorrhoea causes cervicitis and rarely vaginitis. Thereis a purulent thin mucoid slightly yellow pus discharge with no smell and non-itchy

~ Chlamydia causes cervicitis which may present with a nonitchy, thin, colourless discharge

Differential diagnosis

~ Cancer of the cervix (blood-stained smelly discharge)

~ Intra-vaginal use of detergents, chemicals, physical agents and herbs, chronic tampon use, allergic vaginitis

~ Early latent syphilis (<1 year in duration): clinically quiescent but possible relapse of secondary syphilis

~ Late latent syphilis: clinically quiescent, not very infectious (but possible maternal foetal transmission)

~ Late (tertiary) syphilis: at any time after secondary syphilis (even many years):

-nfiltrative tumour of skin, bones, liver

-Aortitis, aneurysms, aortic regurgitation

-Central  nervous  system  disorders  (neurosyphilis):  meningo vascular syphilis, hemiparesis, seizures, progressive degeneration with paraesthesias, shooting pains, dementia, psychosis

Investigations

 Non-treponemal antibody tests (VDRL and RPR)

-Positive 4-6 weeks after infection

-Used as screening test

-Possibility of false positive

-Remains positive 6-12 months after treatment

 Treponemal antibody tests (TPHA): very sensitive, used to confirm a positive non-treponemal test. Remains positive for long even after treatment so its positivity may not indicate active disease.

3.2.9 Congenital STI Syndromes

Congenital STIs in newborns occur as a result of infection of babies in utero or during delivery as a complication of untreated STIs among mothers. Syphilis, HIV, gonococcal, chlamydia and herpes simplex are the most serious congenital STIs.

#### 3.2.9.1 Neonatal Conjunctivitis (Ophthalmia Neonatorum)

3.2.9.1 Neonatal Conjunctivitis (Ophthalmia Neonatorum)

ICD10 CODE: P39.1

Refers to conjunctival infection of neonates by STI organisms in the infected mother's birth canal. It is a very serious condition that can lead to corneal ulceration and ultimately to blindness. Blindness in children is associated with high infant morbidity and mortality.

##### Causes

Causes

~ Commonly caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and

~ Chlamydia trachomatis

~ Other  non-STI  causes  of  neonatal  conjunctivitis  predisposed  by  difficult  labour  such  as  early  rupture  of  membranes, vacuum extraction or other assisted vaginal delivery

##### Clinical features

Clinical features

~ Purulent discharge from one or both eyes within 30 days from birth

~ Inflamed and swollen eyelids

~ Complications of untreated conjuctivitis: corneal ulceration, perforation, scarring and blindness

##### Investigations

Investigations

 Pus swab: Gram stain, Culture & Sensitivity

#### 3.2.9.2 Congenital Syphilis

3.2.9.2  Congenital Syphilis ICD10 CODE: A50

It is a serious debilitating and disfiguring condition that can   be fatal. About one third of syphilis infected mothers have adverse pregnancy outcome, one third give birth to a healthy baby, while the remaining third may result into congenital syphilis infection.

Cause

~ Treponema pallidum bacteria

Cardiovascular Diseases 4

4.1.1 Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism (DVT/PE)

ICD10 CODE: I82.409

Clot formation within the deep venous system, usually of the calf, thigh, or pelvic veins. The clot can cause a local problem at site of formation or dislodge, leading to thromboembolism in various parts of the body, particularly the lungs (pulmonary embolism).

Causes

~ Venous stasis (slowing of blood flow)

~ Increased coagulability states

~ Endothelial injury

#### Risk factors

Risk factors

~ Immobilisation, prolonged bed rest, surgery, limb paralysis

~ Heart failure, myocardial infarction

~ Blunt trauma, venous injury including cannulation

~ Oral contraceptive pills, pregnancy and postpartum

~ Malignancies and some forms of chemotherapy

~ Long distance airtravel

~ Inherited thrombophilic states

~ For PE: any other cause of dyspnoea and chest pain e.g. bronchopneumonia and myocardial infarction

#### Differential diagnosis

Clinical  features

~ 50% of cases may be clinically silent

~ Pain, swelling and warmth of the calf, thigh, and groin

~ Dislodgement of the thrombus may lead to pulmonary embolism characterised by dyspnoea, tachycardia, chest pain, hypotension

~ Half of the cases of PE are associated with silent DVT

Differential diagnosis

 Cellulitis, myositis, phlebitis, contusion

 For PE: any other cause of dyspnoea and chest pain

#### TREATMENT

TREATMENT

Step7

If BP is ≥ 140/90mmHg, refer for further management to a higher level of care.

Provision for specific patients

Assess the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in all patients with hypertension.

Patients with diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke or chronic kidney disease are considered having a high CVD risk.

The target BP is <130/80 mmHg in people with high CVD risk.

Start statin (atorvastatin 20-40 mg once daily or simvastatin 20-40 mg once daily) and aspirin 75mg in people with prior heart attack or ischemic stroke. Consider statin in people at high risk.

Start beta blocker (Atenolol 50mg or Bisoprolol 5mg or Nebivolol 5mg once daily) in people with heart attack in past 3 years.

A combination of ACEI or ARB and a CCB or a diuretic is recommended as initial therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease.

For hypertension secondary to thyroid disease consider adding Propranolol 40mg twice daily

Caution

In pregnancy, do NOT use ACEI or ARBs and diuretics. Methyldopa and calcium channel blockers are safe to use

Don't use both an ACEI  and ARB due to increased risk of side effects

Choice of antihypertensive medicine

Choice of medicine may depend on concomitant risk factors/ other conditions: the table below indicates the suitable medicines for such patients.

5.1 NON-INFECTIOUS RESPIRATORY DISEASES

### 5.1.1 Asthma

5.1.1 Asthma

ICD10 CODE: J45

A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways which leads to muscle spasm, mucus plugging and oedema. It results in recurrent wheezing, cough, breathlessness and chest tightness.

Acute attacks may be precipitated by upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., flu) and exposure to irritant substances (e.g. dust, exercise, and cold).

#### Causes

Causes

~ Not known but associated with allergies, inherited and environmental factors

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

~ No fever (if fever present, refer to pneumonia)

~ Difficulty in breathing (usually recurrent attacks) with chest tightness, with or without use of accessory muscles. Patients may not appear very distressed despite a severe attack

~ Wheezing, rhonchi

~ Cough  -  usually  dry,  may  be  intermittent,  persistent,  or acute, especially at night

Severe forms: failure to complete sentences, darkening of lips, oral mucosa and extremities (cyanosis)

#### Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis

~ Heart failure

~ Other causes of chronic cough

~ Bronchiolitis

~ Bronchiectasis

#### Investigations

Investigations

 Diagnosis is mainly by clinical features

Specialised investigations

 Peak flow rate: the peak flow rate increases to about 200 ml following administration of a bronchodilator

 Spirometry (an increase in Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV) of >12% after bronchodilation)

 Sputum: for eosinophilia

If evidence of bacterial infection

 Chest X-ray

 Blood: complete blood count

General principles of management

The four essential components of Asthma Management: Patient education, control of asthma triggers, monitoring for changes in symptoms or lung function, and pharmacologic therapy.

~ Inhalation route is always preferred as it delivers the medicines directly to the airways; the dose required is smaller, the side-effects are reduced

 E.g., nebuliser solutions for acute severe asthma are given

 over 5-10 minutes, usually driven by oxygen in hospital

#### 5.1.1.1 Acute Asthma

 In children having acute attacks, use spacers to administer inhaler puffs

~ Oral route may be used if inhalation is not possible but systemic side-effects occur more frequently, onset of action is slower and dose required is higher

~ Parenteral  route  is  used  only  in  very  severe  cases  when nebulisation is not adequate.

5.1.1.1 Acute Asthma

Asthma attack is a substantial worsening of asthma symptoms. The severity and duration of attacks are variable and unpredictable. Most attacks are triggered by viral infections. Assess severity using the following table:

Not all features may be present. If the patient says they feel very unwell, listen to them!

#### 5.1.1.2 Chronic Asthma

5.1.1.2 Chronic Asthma

General principles of management

~ Follow a stepped approach

 Before initiating a new drug, check that diagnosis is correct, compliance and inhaler technique are correct and eliminate trigger factors for acute exacerbations

~ Start at the step most appropriate to initial severity

~ Rescue course

 Give a 3-5 days 'rescue course' of prednisolone at any step and at any time as required to control acute exacerbations of asthma at a dose of:

Child < 1 year: 1-2 mg/kg daily; 1-5 years: up to 20 mg daily; 5-15 years: Up to 40 mg daily; adult: 40-60 mg daily for up to 3-5 days.

~ Stepping down

 Review treatment every 3-6 months

 If control is achieved, stepwise reduction may be possible

 If treatment started recently at Step 4 (or contained corticosteroid tablets, see below), reduction may take place after a short interval; in other patients 1-3 months or longer of stability may be needed before stepwise reduction can be done

### 5.1.2 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

5.1.2 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

ICD10 CODE: J42-44

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease characterized by chronic obstruction of lung airflow that interferes with normal breathing and is not fully reversible.

-The more familiar terms 'chronic bronchitis' and 'emphysema' are no longer used, but are now included within the COPD diagnosis.

-Such a diagnosis should be considered in any patient who

-has  symptoms  of  cough,  sputum  production,  or  dyspnea (difficult or labored breathing), and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease.

A COPD exacerbation is an acute worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms needing a change in medications.

Causes and predisposing factors

~ Tobacco smoking is the commonest cause

~ Indoor air pollution: Biomass fuel smoke (firewood, charcoal and cow dung) exposure in poorly ventilated kitchens

~ Exposure  to  occupational  dust  and  chemicals  (cement, paint, saw dust, fumes) without adequate protection

~ It may frequently follow TB disease (residual symptoms)

#### Prevention

Prevention

~ Avoid precipitating factors e.g.

 Cigarette smoking

 Acetylsalicylic acid

 Known allergens such as dust, pollens, animal skins

 Exposure to cold air

~ Exercise can precipitate asthma in children, advise them to keep an inhaler handy during sports and play

~ Effectively treat respiratory infections

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

~ Chronic cough in a current or previous smoker who is over 40 years

~ Breathlessness: persistent, progressive and worse with exercise +/- tight chest and wheezing

~ Chronic sputum (mucuos) production and 'bronchitis' for at least 3 months in 2 successive years

~ On examination,  there  may  be  a  barrel  chest  (increased antero-posterior diameter)

~ Rapid breathing, reduced chest expansion, with or without increased use of accessory muscles of respiration, rhonchi, cyanosis

~ Decreased breath sounds, ankle swelling and other signs of right heart failure

#### Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis

~ Asthma

~ Congestive heart  failure

~ Pulmonary embolism

~ Pulmonary TB

Investigation

 Spirometry: gold standard for diagnosis but if not available use all available tools (history of exposure to risk factors + clinical symptoms + any available investigations).

 History of exposure to risk factors

 Chest X-ray (Hyper-inflated lungs)

 Peak flometry

 Echocardiography - when one suspects right-sided heart failure secondary to COPD

#### Management

Management

~ Treatment aims at:

 Removing risk factors and preventing further damage

 Relief of symptoms and prevention of the severity and frequency of COPD exacerbations

 Improving the patients exercise tolerance and maintaining

~ good health

~ Inhalers are the preferred formulation for the treatment of COPD.



[TABLE]
TREATMENT
LOC
 Explain to the patient that: - COPD is chronic lung damage and there is no cure - Treatment is to prevent exacerbations, further damage, and infections Non-pharmacological management  Advise the patient that: - They must stop smoking - it is the only way to stop it from getting worse - Reduce exposure to charcoal and wood/dung - cooking smoke. Keep cooking areas well- ventilated by opening windows and doors. Use alternative clean energy sources like Biogas, improved cooking stoves etc. - Use masks for respiratory protection or stop working in areas with occupational dust or pollution - Physical exercise to train lung capacity - (pulmonary rehabilitation) under supervision - Get treatment quickly in case of increased breathlessness, cough or sputum  Physiotherapy is beneficial to improve exercise tolerance
HC2
[/TABLE]



#### TREATMENT

TREATMENT

LOC

Step 1: Mild

 Inhaled salbutamol 2 puffs 2-4 times a day, may be used periodically for short periods. The main purpose of this treatment is to reduce or prevent symptoms.

If inhalers not available, consider:

 Aminophylline 200 mg twice dail

HC3

HC4

Step 2: Moderate

 Inhaled salbutamol 2 puffs 2-4 times a day

 Plus inhaled steroid beclomethasone 100-400 micro- grams 2-4 times a day

HC4

Step 3: Severe

 As in step 2 plus ipratropium inhaler 2 puff 2-4 times a day

H

Note

 If  available,  long  acting  bronchodilators  salmeterol and formeterol can be used in moderate and severe COPD in combination with inhaled steroids

RR

COPD exacerbations

~ If more sputum, changed to more yellow/green coloured,  and/or  breathlessness,  temp  >38°C and or rapid breathing ('bronchitis'), then

 Treat with antibiotic e.g. amoxicillin 500 mg every 8 hours for 7-10 days or doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours for 7-10 days

 Oral Prednisolone 40 mg once daily in the morning for 5 days. Do NOT use oral steroids for extended periods in patients with COPD

Refer urgently to hospital if:

Rapid pulse (>100 beats per minute) or breathing (>30 breaths per minute)

### 5.2.4 Acute Epiglottitis

5.2.4 Acute Epiglottitis  ICD10 CODE: J05.1

An acute inflammation of the epiglottis, a rare but serious disease of young children. Airway obstruction is always severe, and intubation or tracheostomy is often needed. It is rare since routine childhood  mmunization with Hib vaccine was introduced.

Cause

~ Bacterial infection, commonly Haemophilus influenzae

#### TREATMENT

TREATMENT

Note

 Avoid cough syrups in children below 6 years

#### Prevention

Prevention

~ Avoid contact with infected persons

~ Include adequate fresh fruits and vegetables in the diet

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

~ Rapid onset of high fever

~ Typical: 'tripod or sniffing' position, preferring to sit, leaning forward with an open mouth, appears anxious

~ Sore throat, difficulty swallowing, drooling, respiratory distress

~ Stridor and maybe cough

~ Appears critically ill (weak, grunting, crying, drowsy, does not smile, anxious gaze, pallor, cyanosis)

~ Asphyxia leading to quick death

#### Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis

~ Laryngeal cause of stridor e.g., laryngotracheobronchitis

Caution

 Avoid  tongue  depression  examination  as  this  may  cause complete airway blockage and sudden death

 Do  not  force  child  to  lie  down  as  it  may  precipitate  airway obstruction

##### Risk factors

Where Xpert MTB/RIF test is not available, do

Sputum smear microscopy for AAFBs (ZN stain) but send the sample for Xpert MTB/RIF test.

GeneXpert MTB/Rif: automated DNA test on body samples (sputum, lymphonodes tissue, pleural fluid, CSF etc) which can diagnose pulmonary TB and determine susceptibility to Rifampicin. It is superior to microscopy.

Other investigations

 Xray, abdominal  ultrasound,  biopsies etc.  can  be  used for  sputum  and  GeneXpert  negative  patients  or  in  case  of extrapulmonary TB according to clinical judgement

 TST can be used as a supportive test to guide decision to treat for TB in children

 putum culture and Drug susceptibility test: is a confirmatory test for TB and also provides resistance pattern to TB medicines. Do this test for:

 Patients with Rifampicin resistance reported with GeneXpert

 Also patients on first-line treatment who remain positive at 2 months and are reported Rifampicin sensitive on GeneXpert

 Patients suspected to be failing on first-line treatment

Note: All presumed and diagnosed TB patients should be offered an HIV test

5.3.1.1Tuberculosis in Children and adolescents

TB may present at any age in children though the risk is highest below the age of two years. When compared to adults, children are more prone to TB infection, TB disease, and severe forms of TB disease.

Risk factors

~ Contact with infectious (pulmonary) case of TB

~ Age < 5 years

#### 5.3.1.2 Drug-Resistant TB

5.3.1.2 Drug-Resistant TB

Drug resistance is said to occur when TB organisms continue to grow in the presence of one or more anti-TB medicines.

~ Although several factors can contribute to the development of drug-resistant TB, inadequate anti-TB treatment is probably  the  most  important.  Inadequate  anti-TB  treatment leads to mutation in drug-susceptibility bacilli making them drug resistant.

##### Clinical features

~ Immunosuppression (HIV, malnutrition, diabetes, etc).

~ Age < 1 year and lack of BCG vaccination are risk factors for severe disease

Clinical features

~ Suspect TB in all children with

-Fever > 2 weeks

-Cough >2 weeks

-Poor weight gain for one month

-Close (home) contact of pulmonary TB case.

-In young children, reduced playfulness, poor feeding, decreased activity

-Other signs include swollen lymph nodes in the neck, groin region etc.

Management

The principles and objectives of TB treatment are similar to those of adults. In addition, effective treatment of TB in children promotes growth and development.

##### Investigations

Investigations

 Bacteriological confirmation of TB is more difficult in children. The diagnosis of TB in children is dependent on conducting a detailed clinical assessment combined with available tests

 Whenever possible, geneXpert should be performed

#### 5.3.1.3 Post-TB patient management

Who is at risk for drug-resistant TB:

 Contact with known drug-resistant tuberculosis

 Retreatments (relapses, treatment after failures, return after loss to follow-up)

 History of frequent interruption of drug treatment

 Patients who remain sputum smear-positive at month 2 or 3 of first-line anti-TB treatment

~ Patients  presumed  to  have  DR-TB  should  be  screened using rapid drug susceptibility testing (DST) of rifampicin (Xpert MTB/RIF, Truenat)

 All patients who are drug-resistant TB suspects should therefore have sputum/other specimens taken for culture and DST.

~ Patients with drug-resistant TB should be linked to desi nated MDR TB treatment initiation centers in the respective regions

DRUG RESISTANT TB IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. INADEQUATE TB TREATMENT IS THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR

5.3.1.3 Post-TB patient management

A post-TB patient is one who was successfully treated for TB but presents with respiratory symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, cough).

~ Re-do standard TB diagnostic evaluation (sputum geneXpert and Chest X ray)

~ If negative, evaluate for post-TB lung disease e.g., bronchiectasias, COPD, pulmonary hypertension.

~ In  most  cases  these  patients  have  residual  lung  damage on Chest X-ray from previous TB, BUT they do not need retreatment if bacteriologically negative

~ Counsel  the  patient  and  give  supportive  treatment  e.g., Pulmonary rehabilitation, etc.

### 5.3.2 Management of TB

5.3.2 Management of TB

General principles

~ The country has adopted patient centered care. It is recommended that all TB medicines are taken under direct observation by a treatment supporter (DOT). Digital Adherence Technologies (DAT) have been introduced to support treatment adherence.

~ Anti-TB drugs are given in fixed dose combination (FDC) regimens according to the patient's TB classification

Treatment is divided into two  phases: an initial (intensive) phase of 2 months and a continuation phase of 4 months (longer in severe forms of TB particularly TB meningitis and osteoarticular TB)TB treatment regimens are expressed in a standard format, e.g. 2RHZE/4RH where:

-Letters represent abbreviated drug names

-Numbers show the duration in months

-shows the division between treatment phases

~ Other shorter term (4-months) treatment regimen recently adopted

2 HRE(Z)/2RH for children 2 months to 16 years

2 HPMZ/2HPM for adults

~ Anti-TB drugs have side effects and they should be managed appropriately (see section 5.3.2.1)

~ TB treatment monitoring should be done by clinical, sputum and where possible radiological

~ A conclusion of 'treatment outcome' status should be done for every patient treated for TB.

First line anti-TB medication

Note

 Rifampicin interacts with oestrogen-containing contraceptives and reduces the protective efficacy of the contraceptives. Use high dose contraceptive or use an additional barrier method.

Important: The choice of regimen now depends on rifampicin sensitivity and not on the previous history of treatment:

 All patients without rifampicin resistance (either new or re-treat- ments) are treated with 1st line regimen.

 Patients with rifampicin resistance (either new or re- treatments) are treated with second line medication in a designated MDR-TB treatment facility.

Susceptible TB: 1st line treatment regimens

For patients without rifampicin resistance to  Gene Xpert MTB/Rif (both new and re-treatment cases).

New cases not belonging to priority (risk) groups and in which diagnosis was done by sputum examination will also be treated with this regimen.

Laboratory Monitoring (For Pulmonary Tb)

At the end of the initial 2 months:

-Sputum smear-negative; start continuation phase

-Sputum smear-positive; do GeneXpert to rule out rifampicin resistance, start continuation phase and Xpert MTB/XDR where accessible, to rule out resistance to other drugs

-If Rifampicin-resistant, refer for MDR-TB treatment and

-If Rifampicin-sensitive, continue with first-line

-treatment, explore adherence issues but repeat smear at

At the beginning of 5 months:

-Sputum smear-negative, continue with continuation treatment

-Sputum smear-positive, diagnose Treatment Failure

-Take sputum  for GeneXpert  to  rule out Rifampicin Resistance and Xpert MTB/XDR where accessible, to rule out resistance to other drugs

-If Rifampicin Resistant, refer for DR treatment

-If  INH  resistant  manage  as  INH  mono-resistant  TB  as above

-If TB detected but not Rifampicin Resistant, restart first line regimen but explore adherence issues

Monitoring of susceptible TB

During the 6th month:

-Sputum smear-negative,  complete  treatment  and  declare cured or treatment completed

-Sputum smear-positive, diagnose treatment failure

-Take sputum for GeneXpert to rule out rifampicin resistance and Xpert MTB/XDR where accessible, to rule out resistance to other drugs

-If Rifampicin-resistant, refer for MDR-TB treatment

-If  Rifampicin-sensitive, restart first-line treatment, explore adherence issues

Clinical Monitoring (For All Tb Cases)

-Monitor wellbeing and weight gain

-Assess and reinforce treatment adherence

-Assess and manage side effects

Note

 Radiological monitoring- this method should not be used as the sole monitoring tool.

Management of treatment interruptions

Refer to NTLP  manual

~ Cough hygiene (cover cough with pieces of cloth, washing hands with soap, proper disposal of sputum)

~ Good nutrition

~ Promote good ventilation in housing & transport

Open ventilators, windows & doors that allow air exchange

5.3.2.3  Tuberculosis Preventive Treatment

Tuberculosis preventive treatment is recommended to prevent the development of active TB disease in an individual who has latent TB infection (LTBI).

Uganda  guidelines for programmatic management of Latent TB infection recommend TB preventive treatment (TPT ) in the following categories of people:

-Persons living with HIV

-Child & adult contacts of pulmonary TB patients

Do not use TPT in cases of active TB

Do not use TPT in contacts of MDR-TB

Note

 HIV-positive children < 1 year should receive TPT only if they have history of contact with TB case and active TB has been excluded



[TABLE]
TREATMENT
LOC
 Exclude active TB - Assess for cough, fever, weight loss and nights sweats (Children: cough, fever, poor weight gain) - If any of the TB symptoms are present, do clinical - evaluation for TB - If none is present, TB is unlikely, then rule out contra-indications for TPT medicines. If none, then give  Give TPT as per dosing chart below.

TREATMENT

LOC

Feeding and nutrition

 No feeding by mouth until signs and symptoms of acute inflammation subside (i.e. cessation of abdominal tenderness and pain, return of hunger and well-being)

 Provide energy with dextrose 50% 300-500 ml a day (add 50 ml to 500 ml Normal saline) to prevent muscle wasting

 Start early oral re-feeding on demand, start within 48-72 hours as soon as the patient is able and can tolerate feeds

 Start with clear liquids, then low fat semi-solid feeds then a normal diet - according to tolerance

 Monitor daily for vital signs, fluid intake, urinary output, and GI symptoms

 If oral feeding not possible, consider peripheral par- enteral and central parenteral nutrition

Glycaemic control (hyperglycaemia is common)

 Keep serum blood sugar between 6-9 mmol/l f Avoid hypoglycemia

Antibiotics

 Avoid inappropriate use of antibiotics and other med- ications e.g. for prophylaxis

 In case of specific infection, e.g. biliary sepsis, pulmo- nary infection, or UTI, treat vigorously with appropriate antibiotic therapy

Other measures

 Address the underlying cause as is appropriate

 Stop alcohol or drugs

Note

 Look out for diabetes mellitus as a consequence of damage to the pancreas

Acute coma due to diabetic ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar hyperglycaemia (see section 8.1.4), or hypoglycaemia (see section 1.1.6)

Chronic complications

1.Microvascular complications: affect the small blood vessels, such as those supplying blood to the eyes and kidneys. The microvascular

#### Differential diagnosis

complications of diabetes are retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy.

Macrovasculary complications: affect the larger blood vessels, such as those supplying blood to the heart, brain and legs: stroke, heart attack, peripheral artery disease

Stroke, ischaemic heart disease, kidney failure

Blindness, impotence, peripheral neuropathy

Diabetic foot which may lead to amputations

#### Investigations

Investigations

 Blood glucose (fasting, random, and/or 2 hours after 75mg of glucose)

 Urine: for glucose, and ketones (in type 1)

HbA1c - Glycated haemoglobin 1c

Other baseline tests- RFTs, Lipid profile, ECG, urine protein or microalbuminuria

Diagnostic criteria

Caution

 In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycaemia (very high levels of blood sugar), criteria 1-3 should be confirmed by repeated testing. One single slightly elevated blood sugar in the absence of symptoms IS NOT DIAGNOSTIC for diabetes

General Management

Goals of treatment

9.1 NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS

### 9.1.1 Epilepsy

9.1.1 Epilepsy ICD10 CODE: G40

~ A chronic condition characterised by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Seizures are caused by abnormal discharges in the brain  and  present  in  two  different  forms:  convulsive  and non-convulsive forms.

~ Convulsive  epilepsy  has  features  such  as  sudden  muscle contraction, causing the person to fall and lie rigidly, followed by the muscles alternating between relaxation and rigidity with or without loss of bowel or bladder control

~ Non-convulsive  epilepsy  has  features  such  as  change  in awareness, behaviour, emotions or senses (such as taste, smell, vision or hearing) similar to mental health conditions, so may be confused with them

~ Consider a diagnosis of epilepsy if a person has had at least 2 seizures in the last calendar year on two different days.

~ Seizures during an acute event (e.g. meningitis, acute traumatic brain injury) are not epilepsy.

#### Causes

Causes

~ Genetic,  congenital  malformation,  birth  asphyxia,  brain tumour

~ Brain infections, cysticercosis, trauma (acute or in the past)

~ Metabolic disorders

~ In some cases, no specific causes can be identified.

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

~ Depending on the type of epilepsy:



[TABLE]
TYPE OFEPILEPSY
DESCRIPTION
Generalized epilepsy
Seizure involves whole brain, consciousness is lost at the onset
Tonic Clonic (grand- mal) or convulsive epilepsy
May commence with a warning sensation in the form of sound, light or abdominal pain (aura) There may be a sharp cry followed by loss of consciousness and falling Tonic contraction (rigidity) of muscles occurs followed by jerking movements (clonic phase) There may be incontinence of urine or faeces, frothing, and tongue biting A period of deep sleep follows
Absence seizures (petit mal)
Mainly a disorder of children The attack is characterized by a brief loss of consciousness (5-10 seconds) in which posture is retained but other activities cease The child has a vacant stare Previous activities are resumed at the end of the attack Several attacks may occur in a single day
Atonic or tonic sei- zures (drop attacks)
Sudden loss of muscular tone, of brief duration (15 seconds), with consciousness maintained or Sudden stiffening of muscle
Myoclonus epilepsy
Abnormal jerking movements occurring usually in the limbs but may involve the whole body
[/TABLE]



#### Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis

 Syncope (fainting),

 Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar)

 Hypocalcaemia (low blood calcium levels)

 Conversion disorder (previously known as hysteria)

 Hyperventilation (fast breathing) and  Panic attacks



[TABLE]
TYPE OFEPILEPSY
DESCRIPTION
Focal Epilepsy
Seizure activity starts in one area of the brain
Simple
Patient remains alert but has abnormal sensory, motor, psychic or autonomic manifestation e.g. jerking of a limb, déjà vu, nausea, strange taste or smell, signs of autonomic nerve dysfunction i.e. sweating, flushing, and gastric sensation, motor contraction or sensory change in a particular point of the body)
Complex
Altered awareness and behaviour e.g. confu- sion, repetitive movements
Status epilepticus
A convulsive state in which the convulsions last >30 minutes or several epileptic convul- sions occur in succession without recovery of consciousness in between or convulsions not responsive to 2 doses of diazepam. It is a medical emergency.
[/TABLE]



#### Investigations

Investigations

 A complete medical and mental health assessment

 Electroencephalogram (EEG)

-Useful in petit mal and focal seizures

-To be done at specialist level (RR and NR)

 Other investigations are guided by suspected cause

#### Management

Management

General principles

~ All  suspected cases of non-convulsive epilepsy should be confirmed and treated by a specialist

~ Convulsive epilepsy can be diagnosed at hospital/HC3

~ level but drug refills should be available at lower levels

~ One brief isolated seizure does not need further treatment but review at 3 months and re-assessment. Treat patients with repeated episodes as per definition

~ Treatment can effectively control epilepsy in most cases

~ Treatment should include psychological and social support

~ Start with a single anti-epileptic medicine

~ Start with low doses and increase gradually according to response

~ If a patient has been seizure free for 2 years, consider gradual stopping of medication

Commonly used antiepileptics include:

~ Generalized tonic-clonic seizures

- Children <2 years: phenobarbital or carbamazepine

- Children >2 years: carbamazepine or valproate

~ Absence seizures: Valproate or ethosuximide

~ Caution:  Avoid  phenobarbital  and  phenytoin  in  children with intellectual disability and/or behavioural problems

Status epilepticus Dextrose 50% 1 mL/kg adults and Dextrose 10% Give diazepam 10 mg IV or rectal 5 mL/kg children - Child: 0.05 mg/kg rectally, 0.02 mg/kg IV repeat dose after 5-10 min if seizures persist If not responsive, consider Phenobarbital 10-15 mg/kg slowly IV. Dilute the solution with 10 times its volume of water for injections and give VERY SLOWLY(at a rate 0.1 mg/minute) - Monitor BP and respiration, be ready to administer IV fluids if hypotension develops and ventilate with Ambu bag in case of respiratory depression Or phenytoin 15-18 mg/kg over 1 hour Phenytoin can cause severe tissue damage so use a good IV line
If not responsive Give another drug (if available) or add phenytoin 10 mg/kg in 30 minutes - Monitor for respiratory depression
[/TABLE]



Chronic epilepsy



[TABLE]
TREATMENT
LOC
General principles Start with a single anti-epileptic medicine. The effective dose must be reached progressively and patient monitored for tolerance and side effects. Aim at the lowest dose able to control (prevent) the seizures If treatment is ineffective (less than 50% reduction in crisis) try another monotherapy (slowly reduce the current antie- pileptic and introduce the new one) If high doses with side effects are required and seizures are anyway infrequent, less than complete control can be the goal Follow up monthly until stable, then every 3 months Warn patient that treatment interruptions can trigger seizures or even status epilepticus If no seizure for 2 years and no known cause like head trauma or infection, consider possibility of stopping treatment (over 2 months). Discuss with the patient
If 2 monotherapy trials fail, refer to specialist Carbamazepine Effective in all generalized tonic-clonic seizures, focal seizures - Given twice daily, steady state reached in 8 days - Adult: starting dose of 100-200 mg daily and increased in 100 mgincrements every 1-2 weeks to a maintenance dose of 400 to 1400 mg daily - Child: starting dose of 5 mg/kg/day and maintenance dose of 10-20 mg/kg/day in divided doses Side effects: skin rash, diplopia, blurred vision, ataxia (stag - gering gait), nausea

TREATMENT
LOC
Phenobarbital Effective for tonic-clonic seizures and focal seizures but is sedative in adults and cause behavioural disturbances and hyperkinesia in children. It may be tried for atypical absences, atonic and tonic seizures - Given once a day in the evening to reduce drowsiness - Adult: starting dose of 1 mg/kg (60 mg) daily for 2 - weeks, if not controlled increase to 2 mg/kg (120 mg) for 2 months, if not controlled increase to 3 mg/kg (180 mg) - Child: starting dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks,if - not controlled increase to 3 mg/kg for 2 months, if not controlled increase until maximum of 6 mg/ kg/day - It takes 2-3 weeks for the drug to achieve steady blood levels so assess effect only after this period Side effects: drowsiness, lethargy, hyperactivity and irritability in children, skin rash, confusion in elderly,
depression Phenytoin Effective in all forms of epilepsy except absences. - Adult: starting dose of 150-200 mg daily as single dose or 2 divided doses and maintenance dose of 200-400 mg daily - Child: starting dose of 3-4 mg/kg and - maintenance dose of 3-8 mg/kg/day (max 300 mg daily) - Increase slowly by 25-30 mg every 2 weeks Side effects: drowsiness, ataxia, slurred speech, blurred vision, twitching, confusion, gum hyperplasia, blood ab- normalities, rash, hepatitis

9.1.4 Childhood Developmental Disorders ICD10 CODE: F80-F89

A broad spectrum of disorders with childhood onset, characterized by impairment or delay in functions related to central nervous system maturation, and with a steady course rather than remissions and relapses as in other mental illnesses. They include intellectual disability/mental retardation as well as pervasive developmental disorders such as autism.

Causes

~ May not be known

~ Nutritional deficiencies e.g. iodine deficiencies

~ Medical conditions

~ Alcohol use during pregnancy

~ Risk factors: maternal depression, infections in pregnancy

Clinical features

~ Delay  in  development  (using  local  developmental  milestones or comparison with other children)

Pervasive developmental disorders including autism

 Impaired social behaviour, communication and language

 Oddities in communication (lack of social use of language skills, lack of flexibility of language used)

 Loss of previously acquired skills

 Narrow range of interests and activities that are both unique to the individual and carried out repetitively originating in infancy or early childhood

 Some degree of intellectual disability may be present

 Some children may be gifted in specific areas e,g Music, computer

Investigations

 Look for other priority mental, neurological or substance use disorder (depression, epilepsy, behavioural disorder)

 Consider if delay in development could be due to non- stimulating environment or maternal depression

 Assess for nutritional and other medical conditions e.g. sensory impairments (blindness, deafness etc.)

Management

10.1.4 Tuberculosis of the Spine (Pott's Disease) ICD10 CODE: A18.01

Tuberculous spondylitis (Pott's disease) is the most common form of skeletal TB; it usually affects the lower thoracic and upper lumbar region. Infection begins with inflammation of the intervertebral joints and can spread to involve the adjacent vertebral body. Once two adjacent vertebrae are involved, infection can involve the adjoining intervertebral disc space, leading to vertebral collapse. Subsequent kyphosis can lead to cord compression and paraplegia.

#### Causes

Causes

Decreased production of red blood cells

~ Nutritional iron, and/or folic acid/vitamin B12 deficiency

~ Depressed bone marrow function (leukaemia, aplasia)

~ Infections (HIV, TB, visceral leishmaniasis)

~ Aplastic anaemia

Increased destruction of red blood cells (haemolysis)

~ Malaria

~ Drug side effects (dapsone, cotrimoxazole, AZT)

~ Congenital disorder, e.g. sickle  cell  anaemia,  G6PD deficiecy

Loss of red blood cells

~ Acute and chronic blood loss (e.g. haemorrhage after trauma,  hookworm  infestation,  pregnancy,  abortion,  heavy menstrual  loss,  schistosomiasis,  massive  or  chronic  GI bleeding)

Clinical features (Commonly)

~ Pallor of conjuctivae, mucous membranes, palms, soles

~ Fatigue, dizziness, palpitations, headache, anorexia, sometimes weight loss, low exercise tolerance

~ Signs  of  heart  failure  if  severe:  oedema  in  lower  limbs, dyspnoea, tachycardia, heart murmurs

~ If due to acute blood loss: postural hypotension, decreased cardiac  out  put,  tachycardia,  sweating,  restlessness  and thirst

~ Look for signs of specific pathology, e.g., splenomegaly, malaria, nutrition deficiency, haemolysis jaundice, etc.

#### Investigations

Investigations

~ Complete  blood  count  (CBC)  with  differentials,  Mean Corpuscular  Volume  (MCV),  platelets,  and  a  peripheral smear, reticulocyte count

~ Evaluate Hb levels according to the patient's age

~ Classify anaemia according to MCV

~ Microcytic  (small  RBCs): measure  serum  ferritin  to evaluate for iron deficiency, HB electrophoresis for thalassemias, sideroblastic anaemia may be caused by drugs like isoniazid and chloramphenicol, evaluate for chronic blood loss especially gastrointestinal bleeding through stool analysis for parasites, and occult blood.

~ Macrocytic: Do vitamin B12 and fasting serum folate levels to evaluate for vitamin B12 orfolate deficiency, do TSH to evaluate for thyroid disease, evaluate for chronic alcohol abuse and use of, drugs like zidovudine, methotrexate, hyroxyureaantifolate medications.

~ Normocytic: evaluate for acute blood loss loss, chronic diseases, renal failure. , Investigate for the cause of hemolysis  using  peripheral  film  for  schistocytes  suggestive  of microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia, HB.

~ Do bone marrow aspirate and biopsy if patient has bone marrow failure for example aplastic anaemia or hematological malignancy for example leukemia, lymphomas and myeloma is suspected.

Note

 Anaemia  is  not  a  final  diagnosis:  careful  history,  physical examination and laboratory tests are essential to determine the cause

##### Management

Management

General principles

 Determine and treat the cause for example Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is used in aplastic anaemia and should be managed by a specialist.

 Consider need for blood transfusion according to:

 Level of haemoglobin

 Clinical condition (haemodynamic status of patient, presence of heart failure, ongoing blood loss)

11.1.1.1 Iron De/uniFB01ciency Anaemia ICD10 CODE: D50

Anaemia due to iron deficiency

Cause

~ Poor nutritional intake with iron-poor foods.

~ Chronic  blood  loss,  e.g.,  infestation  with  hook  worms, prolonged/excessive menstrual bleeding, chronic gastrointestinal bleeding (e.g., chronic use of NSAIDS, large bowel tumors, esophageal varices)

##### Clinical features

Clinical features

~ It usually develops slowly

~ As per general anaemia symptoms plus:

 Sore tongue, atrophy of lingual papillae

 Erosions of the corners of the mouth

 Brittle, fragile  fingernails

##### Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis

~ Conditions that cause microcytic red cells

##### Investigations

Investigations

 Blood: CBC, Hb, (haematocrit (Hct) rarely <28% unless iron deficiency is present)

##### TREATMENT

 Low MCV and Mean Corpuscular Hb (MCH)- hypochromia. This may not be obvious in patients who have already been transfused

 Hypochromic microcytic (small size) red cells

 Investigate the cause of iron deficiency

Management

TREATMENT

 Child: Oral ferrous sulphate 5 mg/kg (max 200 mg) every 8 hours (equivalent to around 5 mg/kg elemental iron per day)

Hb rises  in  2-3  weeks  and  returns  to  normal  after 2  months

Treat  for  6  months  to  1  year  to  replenish  stores

 Give an antihelminthic

Albendazole 400 mg single dose

Refer to hospital in case of:

Severe symptoms - for blood transfusion

Gastrointestinal bleeding

Malabsorption

Intolerance to oral therapy

Unclear cause - not improving

#### 11.1.1.2 Megaloblastic Anaemia

11.1.1.2  Megaloblastic Anaemia ICD10 CODE: D51-52

Anaemia characterised  by large red blood cells.  Usually due to folate and/or vitamin B12 deficiency. Some medicines (hydroxyurea, zidovudine, stavudine can cause macrocytic anaemia without folate and/or vitamin B12 deficiency).

Cause

~ Low dietary intake of folate/increased need (e.g., children, pregnancy)

~ Low dietary intake of vitamin B12 (in exclusively vegetarian diets, without any animal proteins)

~ Malabsorption of folate and vitamin B12 (severe gastritis, giardia infection, severe intestinal diseases)

~ Medicines e.g., metformin, zidovudine, hydroxyurea, stavudine, phenytoin

~ Other causes of macrocytosis: myelodysplasia, hypothyroidism, chronic alcohol use, multiple myeloma

##### Clinical features

Note

 Side effects of oral iron: diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort, constipation, black stools. Warn patient not to worry

 Parenteral iron is rarely necessary, and can cause anaphylaxis.It should only be used by specialists

Clinical features

~ General anaemia signs

~ Vitamin  B12  deficiency:  neuropsychiatric  abnormalities e.g.,    hyperpigmented  palms  and  feet,  smooth  beefy tongue, peripheral neuropathy, impaired vibration and position sense, abnormal gait, weakness, decreased muscle strength,  spastic  motions,  memory  loss,  disorientation, depression, and acute confusional state

##### Investigations

Investigations

~ Blood smear: macrocytosis

~ Elevated MCH/MCV

~ Pancytopenia in severe cases

~ Full blood count: oval macrocytes, hypersegmentation of neutrophils, thrombocytopenia

~ Decreased serum Vitamin B12 or fasting red cell folate

#### 11.1.1.3 Normocytic Anaemia

11.1.1.3  Normocytic Anaemia

Anaemia characterised by normal-sized red blood cells

Cause

~ Acute blood loss

~ Haemolysis (destruction  of  red  cells),  e.g.,  auto-immune disorder, hypersplenism, haemoglobin abnormalities (sickle  cell  disease,  thalassemia),  drugs  (sulphonamides, dapsone, primaquine)

~ Decreased reticulocytosis (formation of new blood cells),

~ e.g. chronic kidney disease and chronic diseases ..

##### Clinical features

Note

 If  vitamin  B12  deficiency  is  suspected:  (low  leucocytes and  platelets,  neuropsychiatric  symptoms,  vegan  diet)  DO NOT GIVE folic acid alone but refer for further testing and treatment. Giving folic acid alone in

 patients  with  B12  deficiency  may  precipitate  permanent neurological deficit.

 Anaemia normally corrects  within  1-2  months.  White  cell count and thrombocytopenia normalise within 7-10 days

 DO NOT use ferrous-folate combination tablets to treat folic deficiency because the quantity of folic acid is too low

Clinical features

~ General features of anaemia

Prevention/Health Education for Anaemia

Educate the public about:

~ The life long effects of anaemia on health, and cognitive development

~ Dietary  measures:  encourage  exclusive  breastfeeding  for the first 6 months. Encourage the use of iron-containing weaning  locally  available  foods  (red  meat,  beans,  peas, dark leafy vegetables)

~ Hygiene: avoid walking barefeet to avoid hook worm infestation, use of pit latrines for faecal disposal, and practice good hand washing habits

~ Medical:  encourage  periodic  screening  for  children  and pregnant mothers, and presumptive iron therapy for either groups in cases of anaemia (see IMCI and pregnancy guidelines, chapters 16 and 17)

~ Routine iron supplementation for all pregnant mothers

~ Early treatment of malaria, helminthic infections, etc.

### 11.1.2 Bleeding Disorders

11.1.2  Bleeding Disorders ICD10 CODE: D65-D69

A bleeding disorder is suspected if a patient has unexplained bruising and bleeding (i.e. no history of trauma). Prolonged bleeding or oozing can also occur after injury or surgery (e.g., tooth extraction, small cut).

#### Causes

Causes

~ Blood vessel defect

 Acquired: age, side effects of steroids, NSAIDS (e.g. easy bruising)

 Genetic e.g. hereditary telangiectasia

~ Platelet defect

 Decreased platelet number/function e.g., blood cancer, viruses, aplastic anaemia

 Increased destruction e.g., in hypersplenism, autoimmune disease, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) massive blood transfusion

~ Coagulation defect

 Hereditary e.g., haemophilia A or B, von Willebrand disease

 Acquired e.g., warfarin or heparin, liver disease, alcoholism, ac- quired factor inhibitors for example in malignancies, autoimmune diseases and pregnancy.

 Infections: meningococcal sepsis, haemorrhagic fevers (causing widespread endothelial damage and disseminated intravascular coagulation)

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

~ Platelet disorder: mucosal bleeding (gingivitis, nose bleeds), superficial ecchymoses, excessive bleeding after minor in- jury, petechiae, heavy menstrual bleeding

~ Coagulation  disorder:  large,  deep  haematomas  or  hae- mathrosis

#### Investigations

Investigations

 Complete blood count, and platelet count (can be estimated using a peripheral smear if an auto-analyser is not available)

 A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy is indicated if a haematological malignancy is suspected to be the cause of the bleeding

 Bleeding time (time required for bleeding to stop). It is normal with coagulation factor deficiencies (except Von Willebrand disease), and abnormal in thrombocytopenia and qualitative platelet defects

 Coagu lation tests

 Prothrombin  time  (PT):  prolonged  in  factor  VII,  X,  V,  II deficiencies, liver disease, warfarin treatment

 International normalised ratio (INR) to monitor anticoagulation with warfarin (not useful for heparin and direct acting anticoagulants like rivaroxaban)

 Partial  thromboplastin  time  (aPTT):  prolonged  in  factor  VIII, (hemophilia A) XII, XI, IX, (hemophilia B) X, V and I deficiencies

 If acute, consider if haemorrhagic fevers are the cause

#### Management

Management

Patients with acute bleeding disorders should be referred to hospital for appropriate investigations and treatment.

Patients with chronic bleeding disorders should be referred to a specialist.

### 11.1.3 Sickle Cell Disease

 In patients with ITP, first line treatment is oral prednisolone (0.5-2mg/kg/day). Rituximab and Intravenous Immunoglob- ulin (IVIG) are second line treatments for ITP, however these should be given by a specialist.

 Transfuse with platelets if Patient is bleeding (therapeutic transfusion) or prophylactically when platelet count is less than 10,000/µL in patients at high risk of bleeding - e.g., cancer patients.

 Transfuse with fresh fozenfrozen plasma if bleeding is thought to be due to disorders related to clotting factors

Refer to a higher level of care if the above options are not viable.

H

Referral criteria

 Refer patient to hospital if any of the following signs are present

 If cause cannot be determined locally

 Spontaneous bleeding

 Bleeding into muscles or joints, GIT, or CNS

 Bleeding patients who are on warafrin

 Postpartum bleeding

 Family history of bleeding

RR

Health education

~ Advise the patient with chronic bleeding disorder to:

 Prevent injury

 Avoid injections and unnecessary surgery

 Visit the clinic immediately if symptoms occur

 Continue all medication as prescribed

~ All haemophiliacs should have prophylactic treatment be- fore traumatic procedures, e.g., tooth extractions, or sur- gery

11.1.3 Sickle Cell Disease ICD10: D57

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic haemoglobin disorder in which

red blood cells which carry oxygen around the body change shape from a smooth doughnut shape into a crescent or half-moon shape. It is sometimes called Sickle Cell Anaemia (SCA).

Cause

~ It is caused by a defect in beta chains where a given amino acid is replaced by another (Substitution of valine for glutamic acid) at position 6 of the chain. This change creates abnormal haemoglobin called HbS.

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

~ Symptoms  usually  appear  from  age  of  3  to  6  months: anaemia, dactylitis (swelling of fingers), lobar pneumonia, recurrent severe bacterial infections. This results from the reduction of the foetal haemoglobin F (HbF), and increase in HbS in the blood

~ Chronic  anaemia:  Hb  6-9  g/dl  with  episodes  of  acute worsening, which can be due to

 Aplastic crisis: sudden transient arrest of blood cells  production in the bone marrow (low Hb and low  reticulocyes), often due to ParvoB19 virus infection)

 Splenic sequestration: pooling of large amounts of red blood cells  in  the  spleen  with  painful  and  rapidly  enlarging  spleen, decreasing haemoglobin with high reticulocyte count

~ Acute  vaso-occlusive  phenomenon  (occlusion  of  blood vessels) causing:

 Painful crisis (acute, intense) at the back, chest, limbs, abdomen. In children <2 years, pain and swelling of hands and feet.

 Stroke: hemiplegia, altered consciousness, seizures.

 Acute chest syndrome: fever, chest pain, difficulty in breathing, low oxygen level, cough, wheezing

 Acute abdomen or mesenteric crisis ('intestinal crisis'): abdominal  pain  and  distension,  reduced  or  absent  bowel sounds, pallor, fever, Abdominal X-ray may show dilated bowel loops.  Anaemia,  high  reticulocyte  count,  high  CRP  will  be present.

 Renal infarction, bone infarction and necrosis, especially at the head of femur, priapism

#### Investigations

~ Chronic organ damage due to anaemia and vasocclusive phenomenon:

 Hyposplenia (spleen undergoes autosplenectomy due to multiple  infarcts  and  is  not  functional  anymore  or  has  to  be removed because of splenic sequestration)

 Pulmonary hypertension, asthma

 Chronic renal and hepatic disease, gallbladder stones

 Nephropathy and acute kidney injury due to hypovolemia and hypoperfuson

 Trans-cranial doppler velocity of >200cm/sec predicts high risk of having a stroke. This is less predictive in adults

 Osteoporosis, retinopathy

 Chronic leg ulcers

~ Infections associated with asplenia and hyposplenism like pneumococcal infections

 Osteomyelitis, pneumonia, septicaemia

Investigations

~ Family history of sickle cell disease

~ Full blood count & peripeharl film comment

~ Screening tests for sickling (not fully reliable)

~ Haemoglobin electrophoresis (confirms diagnosis)

~ Chest radiography (for Acute Chest Syndrome)

~ Abdominal ultrasound

~ Urinalysis

~ Liver and renal function tests

11.2 Blood And Blood Products

The Uganda Blood Transfusion Service (UBTS) collects blood and produces all blood products. Whole blood (WB): unseparated blood collected inanapprovedcontainerandcontainingapreservative or anticoagulant solution 'Blood'referstoany blood component in which the main constituentisredbloodcells,e.g.,wholeblood(WB), red cell concentrate,orred cell suspension

Unless otherwise specified, others are referred to as blood components or products. Blood components are preparedfrom WB, and contain negligible quantity of red cells,e.g., platelet concentrate, Fresh Frozen Plasma, Cryoprecipitate.(Referto the 'National Blood Transfusion Guidelines for appropriate use of blood' formoredetails) UBTS ensures that all blood and blood products are producedinaway that ensures the health and safety of both patients and donors andminimisesthe risk

### 11.2.1 General Principles of Good Clinical Practice in Transfusion Medicine

11.2.1 General Principles of Good Clinical Practice in Transfusion Medicine

~ Blood  is  a  scarce  and  expensive  resource.  Blood  transfusion  carries  risks  of  adverse  reactions  and  transfusion-transmitted infections

~ Use blood appropriately, that is, to treat conditions that can lead to significant morbidity or mortality, which cannot be prevented or effectively managed by other means

~ Minimise the need for transfusion by:

 Early diagnosis, and treatment of anaemia, in particular iron deficiency anaemia

 Stop blood loss, through good  surgical and  anaesthetic management

 Appropriate and timely management of coagulation disorders

 Use  of  simple  alternatives  to  transfusion  when  appropriate, e.g., IV fluids as first line treatment of hypovolemic shock

Prescribe transfusion according to patients individual needs, using clinical signs and symptoms, and expected outcome, but NOT only according to Hb level

Do not use blood transfusion to:

 Expand blood volume, unless there has been blood loss of >30% of total volume

 Enhance wound healing

 'Top up' Hb prior to surgery

 Improve  general  well-being  of  the  patient  in  patients  with on-going fluid losses, e.g. surgical blood loss

~ Blood should not be transfused unless it has been:

 Obtained from appropriately selected donors (voluntary non-remunerated donors)

### 11.2.2 Blood and Blood Products: Characteristics and Indications

11.2.2 Blood and Blood Products: Characteristics and Indications

The following section will present only whole blood and red cells concentrate. Availability and use of other blood components is reserved for referral hospitals and is beyond the scope of this guideline.

#### 11.2.2.1 Whole Blood

 Screened for transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs), namely; HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis Tested for compatibility (pre-transfusion) between the donor's red cells and the antibodies in the patient's plasma in accordance with national guidelines

~ The mandate to collect blood from donors, and screen it for TTI is reserved for UBTS

~ Guidelines and procedures for requesting, administering, and recording blood transfusion should be clearly spelled out,  and  strictly  followed  to  avoid  catastrophic  mistakes (see below for)

~ Ensure the transfused patient is closely monitored (during and after transfusion) and that there is immediate response if any adverse reactions occur

11.2.2.1 Whole Blood

~ Whole blood provides red blood cells, plasma volume, stable coagulation factors (VII, XI), and others

~ May not have enough functional platelets and labile coagulation factors (V and VIII)

~ It is also used as a raw material from which other blood components are prepared

~ 1 unit of whole blood is about 450 ml of donor blood; obtained from a single donation plus 63 mL of anticoagulant/preservative solution. It is available from HC4 level

~ Hct is approximately 35%

~ Each unit of blood will raise the HB by about 1g/dl

#### 11.2.2.2 Red Cell Concentrates (packed red cells)

Indications

~ Red  blood  cell  replacement  in  acute  blood  loss  (haemorrhage) with significant hypovolaemia such as in trauma, surgery, invasive procedures, GIT haemorrhage

~ Patients  in  need  of  red  blood  cell  transfusion,  where  red cell concentrates or suspensions are not available (consider adding furosemide to avoid fluid overload)

~ Only Specialist Use: exchange transfusion in neonates, using less than 5-day old blood units

Dose

 Adults: 1 unit at a time

 Children: 20mL/kg

Caution

~ Transfusion must be started within 30 minutes of removal from  the  refrigerator,  and  completed  within  4  hours  of starting

~ Storage is 2-6°C in approved blood bank refrigerator with temperature charts and alarm

~ WB is contraindicated in severe chronic anaemia and incipient cardiac failure (risk of volume overload)

~ Blood should not be warmed (improvised warming method commonly used in health facilities is not necessary)

~ The routine use of diuretics (furosemide, or lasix), pre-transfusion is not necessary in most patients. Pre-transfusion diuretics are indicated in known cardiac and renal patients - to prevent circulatory overload.

11.2.2.2 Red Cell Concentrates (packed red cells)

Red cell concentrates contain red blood cells, suspended in a small amount of plasma and additive solutions (which provides nutrients to the red cells in storage). It is in a form of two, or three pediatric bags,

each containing 80-150 ml, obtained from a single donation. HCT is approximately 55%. It is available from HC4 level.

Indications

~ Red blood cell replacement in anaemic patients

~ In  acute  blood  loss,  together  with  crystalloid  solution  if WB is not available

Caution

~ Transfusion must be started within 30 minutes of removal from  the  refrigerator,  and  completed  within  4  hours  of starting

~ Storage is 2-6°C in approved blood bank refrigerator with temperature  charts  and  alarm

11.2.2.3 Clinical Indications for Blood Transfusion

The indication for blood transfusion (with whole blood or red cell concentrates) depends on:

 The degree of anaemia (estimated by Hb level)

 The clinical conditions (high risk or presence of signs and symptoms of tissue hypoxia, or impaired tissue oxygenation resulting from anemia or blood loss)

Presence of ongoing blood loss (e.g., internal or external  haemorrhage)

Severe acute anaemia in children and infants

Transfuse, if;

~ Hb ≤ 4 g/dL (or haematocrit ≤ 12%), whatever the clinical condition of the patient

~ Hb  4 - 6 g/dL (or haematocrit 13-18%), in case of life threatening complications, such as, clinical features of hypoxia and cardiac decompensation, acidosis (usually causes respiratory distress , impaired consciousness/coma, hyperparasitaemia (>20%) or cerebral malaria, septicaemia,

meningitis

Dose: Transfuse 10-15 mL/kg of packed red cells (or 20 mL/kg of whole blood)

Note: In children with chronic anaemia caused by iron deficiency, it may be possible to correct with iron therapy alone.

Severe anaemia in adults

~ Consider blood transfusion only in anaemia whose severity is likely to cause/ has already caused clinical signs of hypoxia, or impaired tissue oxygenation. These signs may include;  tachycardia,  shock,  respiratory  distress,  weakness, dizziness and or unconsciousness.

 Symptomatic anaemia (see above) in adults with <7 g/dL

 Haemoglobin <8g/dL if with cardiac disease or CNS symptoms

~ Give the minimum number of transfusions necessary to relieve hypoxia:

 Transfuse 1 unit at a  time, then re-assess

 If symptoms persist give another unit

 Transfuse in 2-4 hours

Severe anaemia in pregnancy

~ Generally,  it  is  important  to  screen  for  iron  deficiency anaemia early in pregnancy and treating with iron as necessary.

Pregnancy <36 weeks

~ Hb  5 g/dL irrespective of clinical condition

~ Hb 5-7 g/dL in case of established or incipient heart failure/impaired tissue oxygenation, pneumonia or other serious infection, malaria, pre- existing heart disease

Pregnancy >36 weeks

~ Hb ≤ 6 g/dL

 Hb 6-8 g/dL in case of, established or incipient heart failure/impaired tissue oxygenation, pneumonia or other serious infection,

malaria, pre-existing heart disease

Elective caesarean section

If history of APH, PPH, previous caesarean section

~ Hb is 8-10 g/dL

 Establish/confirm blood group, and save freshly taken serum for cross-matching

~ Hb <8 g/dL

 Have 2 units of blood cross-matched and made available

Pre-operative anaemia

Pre-operative anaemia should be investigated, and promptly managed before surgery;

 Prompt management may include iron supplementation (oral, on intravenous)

 Where possible, surgery should be delayed or postponed, until anaemia is corrected, since pre-operative anemia is associated with poor surgical outcomes (morbidity and mortality), as well as an increased need for blood transfusion.

~ ≤ 8 g/dL in case of:

 Inadequate compensation for the anaemia (symptomatic anaemia)

 Significant co-existing cardiorespiratory disease

 Major surgery or significant blood loss expected

 Pre-surgical correction has not been possible

Management of acute haemorrhage/hypovolemia

~ IV  fluids  (crystalloids:  Normal  saline)  is  the  first  line  in treatment of hypovolaemia during acute haemorrhage

~ Whole  blood  (or  red  blood  cells  if  WB  unavailable)  are indicated when blood loss is >20- 30% of blood volume (>15-20 mL/kg)

~ The need for blood must be determined by:

 Amount and speed of blood loss

~ Blood transfusion is not necessary for asymptomatic sickle cell patient with steady Hb 6-8 g/dL nor for an uncompli- cated painful episode

~ In addition to general indications, blood transfusion is in- dicated if:

 Acute severe anaemia (Hb <5 g/dL or 2 g/dL lower than usual level for the patient) in aplastic and acute sequestration crisis. Aim at Hb 7-8 g/dL

 Hb <6 g/dL in uncomplicated pregnancy

 Hb <8 g/dL if caesarean section

 Hb <9 g/dL in case of acute chest syndrome (ACS), or stroke. For these four patient categories (pregnancy, C/section, ACS, and stroke), the target Hb is 11g/dL, and not any higher.

~ Use  packed  cells  if  available  (rather  than  WB)-  whole blood is indicated

Neonatal conditions

~ Severe anaemia (of any cause (prematurity, sepsis, etc.)

~ Transfusion in neonates should be managed at specialist level

11.2.3 Adverse Reactions following Transfusion

Any potentially adverse sign or symptom resulting from a blood transfusion.

Common Acute Transfusion reactions (ATR)include;

 Minor allergic reaction (Urticaria)

 Febrile non-haemolytic transfusion reaction

 Acute haemolytic transfusion reaction (caused by ABO incompat- ibility): is a s e v e r e ,   a n d   life  threatening reaction

 Bacterial contamination

 Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)

 Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)

 Severe allergic (Anaphylactic) reaction; relatively rare

Delayed Transfusion reactions

~ Transfusion-transmitted infections, e.g., HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C

~ Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions

General principles

~ Acute transfusion reactions (ATRs) may occur in 1-2% of transfused patients.

~ Rapid recognition and management of transfusion reactions may save the patient's life

Key points

~ Accurate patient identification - at bed side, is critical during;

 Blood sample collection

 Administration of blood

~ Monitoring transfusion is only way to identify ATRs

~ Monitoring  transfusion  is  performed  by  taking  vital signs; before, 15 minutes into, whenever a reaction is suspected, and at the end of transfusion

~ Vital signs should always be taken (at a minimum) immediately prior to beginning the transfusion, 15 min after start and at end (see box with Key Points). In addition, a nurse or  physician  should  observe  the  patient  for  the  first  15 minutes after a new blood unit is started, and vital signs recorded

~ Errors  and  failure  to  follow  correct  procedures  are  the most common causes of life threatening acute haemolytic reactions. Such errors include; misidentification of patients - resulting in administering the wrong blood unit to the  wrong patient,  not  repeating  blood  grouping  of  the blood units received at hospital, not cross-matching, and errors in labeling blood samples for pre-transfusion grouping and cross-match. These errors must be avoided.

~ ALWAYS store blood used for the compatibility testing for 7 days at 2-8°C for possible investigation on transfusion reactions

~ In  a  conscious  patient  with  a  severe  acute  haemolytic transfusion reaction, signs/symptoms may appear within minutes of infusing only 5-10 mL of blood

 In an unconscious or anaesthetised patient, hypotension, hypoxia and uncontrolled bleeding may be the only signs of a transfusion problem. As such, taking vitals regularly is important.

Vital signs taken;

 Temperature

 BP

 Respiratory rate

 Pulse rate

~ Any unexpected change(s) in vitals  =  a  possible  ATR, until proved otherwise

If atransfusion reaction is suspected

 Stop the transfusion, and remove the giving set. Prior to disconnecting, the unit must be closed to avoid reflux of patient blood into the donor blood

12.1 INTRODUCTION

Cancer is an unregulated growth of a previously normal set of body cells. Oncology is the study, diagnosis, and management of cancers or tumours. It is important to note that any organ or system as well as any individual can be affected by cancer. This section will outline major symptoms and signs of cancer, key population groups affected, ways to mitigate risk of cancer and provide an overview of common cancers in adults and children.

Cancer or malignant neoplasm is collective term for a group of more than 100 diseases that result from abnormal / uncontrolled growth of body cells and is able to invade normal tissues and spread to other parts of the body. The uncontrolled growth causes a lump/ swelling called a tumours or neoplasm in many types of cancer or an abnormal number of abnormal cells in some types of cancer such as blood cancers (Leukaemia).  Tumours are broadly divided into benign tumors, meaning non-cancerous / unable to metastasize (spread to other parts of the body) or malignant tumors (able to invade normal tissues / spread to other parts of the body). Cancers are classified by their type of cell, tissue, or organ of origin.  In Uganda, in 2020, it was estimated that there were 34,008 new cancer cases, 22,992 cancer deaths, and 62,548 adults living with cancer. The top five causes of cancer morbidity are cervix, Kaposi sarcoma (KS), breast, prostate, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The top five causes of cancer deaths are cancers of the cervix, KS, esophagus, liver, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In Uganda, children aged 0 - 14 years of age, constitute ten percent (10%) of cancer patients.

12.1.2.1 Urgent Signs and Symptoms

Common Signs and Symptoms of Cancer

Health workers should inform clients / communities that don't wait for signs and symptoms of cancer. In most types of cancer, signs and symptoms manifest when the disease is advancing or in late stage. Each

type of cancer manifest with unique signs and symptoms. However, many cancer patients report having experienced / noticed some symptoms or signs weeks/ months / years earlier before they felt very sick.

Cancer should be investigated in an individual with the following common signs and symptoms of cancer, especially when having occurred for >2 weeks:

 Sudden unexplained weight loss

 Painless or painful swelling, lump, or thickening

12.2 Prevention of Cancer

Cancer prevention means activities or actions directed at avoiding, reducing, eliminating, or eradicating the risk of developing cancer or the impact of cancer on individuals and populations to promote health.

Approximately 40% of cancers are preventable through interventions such as prevention of oncogenic infections (HPV, HIV, HBV, etc), alcohol, tobacco, and, environmental controls, promotion of healthy diets, and physical activity.

Prevention offers the most cost-effective long-term strategy for control of cancer.

Health workers are responsible for educating the public on:

~ Primary Prevention - sustained action to prevent a cancerous process from developing through risk factor reduction

~ Secondary Prevention - active  discovery  and  control  of cancerous or pre-cancerous lesions

### 12.2.1 Primary Prevention

12.2.1 Primary Prevention

Prevention of cancer includes activities or actions directed at avoiding, reducing, eliminating, or eradicating the risk of developing cancer prior to the onset of cancer.

#### 12.2.1.1 Control of Risk Factors

Primary prevention gives control to the individual in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and environment to avoid or reduce cancer risk.

12.2.1.1 Control of Risk Factors

Smoking/Tobacco Use

 Tobacco  use  increases  the  risk  of  several  types  of  cancer, especially  cancer  of  the  lungs,  oesophagus,  larynx,  mouth, throat, kidney, bladder, pancreas, stomach, and cervix

 Health workers must educate patients / clients / communities on the dangers of tobacco consumption and smoking; patients should be advised to avoid tobacco use. For patients /clients who smoke or use tobacco in any other form, health workers must encourage and support them to stop tobacco use.

Unhealthy Diet

Consumption of unhealthy (unbalanced diet, sweetened food and beverages, charred, and unhygienic food) increases the risk of several types of cancer, especially cancer of the colon and rectum, mouth, pharynx, and larynx, corpus uteri, breast, kidney, liver, pancreas, esophagus, thyroid, prostate, multiple myeloma, and gallbladder.

 Health workers must educate patients / clients / communities to:

 balance their diet with various types of healthy foods,

 eat plenty of healthy food such as whole grains, pulses, fruits, and vegetables,

 limit food high in sugar or fat and avoid sugary drinks,

 limit the amount of salt intake,

 limit eating red meat and avoid eating processed meat,

 avoid eating burnt or charred food.

Overweight and Obesity

Being overweight or obese increases the risk of cancer, specifically the oesophageal, colorectal, breast, endometrial, and kidney cancers.

Heath workers must advise patients to maintain a healthy lifestyle, especially, regular physical activity and a healthy diet.

Also, inform them to maintain their body weight within the healthy range.

Physical inactivity

Sedentary lifestyle increases the risk of colon, endometrial, bladder, breast, lung, esophageal adenocarcinoma, renal, and gastric cancers.

Heath workers must advise patients / clients to be physically active in everyday life. Limit the time you spend sitting and engage in at least 30 minutes of regularly physical activity per day or on most days of the week.

Alcohol Use

Excess consumption of alcohol increases the risk of cancer of the oral cavity, oesophagus, larynx, liver, colorectal, and breast.

Health workers should educate patients / clients/ communities of the dangers of excessive and regular alcohol consumption.  The key messages should include: Not drinking alcohol is better for cancer prevention. If you drink alcohol of any type, limit your intake.

Environmental Pollution

Regular exposure to carcinogenic chemicals in the environment can occur through unsafe drinking water, air pollution, and food contaminated by aflatoxin or dioxin chemicals, occupational exposure to dangerous gases or dusts.

Environmental carcinogens (aflatoxins, asbestos, vehicle emissions, lead, ultraviolet light, and ionizing radiation) will lead to increased risk of developing cancer, e.g. lung cancer

Health workers must educate patients on environmental dangers and provide suggestions to limit exposure such as:

 Limiting indoor air pollution due to smoke from use of charcoal

and firewood inside a poorly ventilated house

 Avoiding fumes from cars

 Avoiding exposure to garbage pollution (burning rubbish)

 Employers  should  provide  employees  with  a  safe  working environment with limited occupational hazards

Oncogenic Infections

The following infections are associated with causing certain types of cancer:

 Viral Hepatitis B/C: cancer of the liver

 Human Papilloma Virus (HPV): cervical, oral, anal, and cancer

 Helicobacter Pylori: Gastric (stomach) cancer

 HIV/AIDS: aggressive lymphoma subtypes, Kaposi's sarcoma, anorectal cancer, cervical cancer, etc.

 Schistosomiasis: increases risk of bladder cancer

 Liver Fluke: increases risk of cholangio-carcinoma

 Preventative  measures  to  control  oncogenic  infection  risk include      vaccination,  and  prevention/treatment  of  infection and    infestation:

 Engage in safe sexual behaviour to avoid sexually transmitted diseases that can cause or increase the risk of certain types of cancer such as cervical, Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma, and liver cancers.

 HPV Vaccination: vaccinate all girls aged 10 years with 2 doses of HPV vaccine (for detail see section 18 on immunization)

 Hepatitis  B  Vaccination:  routinely  offered  in  the  national childhood schedule and populations at risk, in order to prevent infection with hepatitis B, the main risk factor for liver cancer (for detail see section 18 on immunization)

 Treatment  of  HIV/AIDS,  schistosomiasis,  H.  pylori,  and hepatitis B&C and other infections is also a preventive measure.

Radiation

~ Ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and in particular solar radiation, is carcinogenic to humans, causing all major types of skin cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma

 People with albinism are at a much higher risk of skin cancer and health workers should encourage them to wear protective clothing and wide brimmed hats

### 12.2.2 Secondary Prevention

~ Ionizing radiation from radioactive isotopes (used in medical diagnostics and treatment) is also associated with leukaemia and other solid tissue tumours. Proper disposal of highly radioactive isotopes is mandatory to prevent hazardous exposures

Prevention of Infections

The following infections are associated with causing certain types of cancer:

~ Viral Hepatitis B/C: cancer of the liver

~ Human Papilloma Virus (HPV): cervical cancer

~ Helicobacter Pylori: stomach cancer

HIV/AIDS: aggressive lymphoma subtypes, Kaposi's sarcoma, anorectal cancer, cervical cancer, etc

~ Schistosomiasis: increases risk of bladder cancer

~ Liver Fluke: increases risk of cholangio-carcinoma

~ Preventative  measures  to  control  infection  risk  include vaccination,  and  prevention/treatment  of  infection  and infestation:

~ HPV Vaccination: immunize all girls from age 10 with 2 doses of HPV vaccine (see section 18.1)

~ Hepatitis B Vaccination: routinely offered in the national childhood  schedule  and  populations  at  risk,  in  order  to prevent infection with hepatitis B, the main risk factor for liver cancer (see section 18.2.2)

~ Treatment of HIV/AIDS, schistosomiasis, H. pylori, and hepatitis  B&C  and  other  infections  is  also  a  preventive measure

12.2.2 Secondary Prevention

Secondary prevention of cancer includes activities or actions directed at halting the progress of cancer at its incipient stage through screen-

ing, early diagnosis, pre-cancer treatment or cancer management, and referral to avoid or reduce complications associated with the cancer. Secondary prevention strategies relate to the discovery and control of cancerous or pre-cancerous lesions.

Early detection of cancer greatly increases the chances for successful treatment and cure. It comprises of:

~ Early diagnosis in symptomatic populations

~ Screening in asymptomatic high-risk populations

Screening refers to the use of simple tests across a healthy population in order to identify individuals who have disease, but do not yet have symptoms.

Based on existing evidence, mass population screening is advocated for breast and cervical cancer. Other cancers that are commonly screened for include prostate and colorectal cancers

Screening for Breast Cancer

Screening / health checkup for breast cancer involves:

Breast Self-Examination (BSE): a simple, quick examination done by the client herself, aimed at early detection of lumps. Regular (monthly-not during menstruation, at least seven days after ending the menstruation) and correct technique of breast examination is important and easy to teach and administer. Health workers should note that BSE is not a standard screening test for breast cancer, but is beneficial for breast health awareness.

Clinical Breast Examination (CBE): performed by a trained and skilled health care provider from HC3

 Take a detailed history and conduct a physical

 examination

 All breast quadrants must be examined in detail plus the armpits for lymph nodes

 Inspect the skin for changes and swellings, for tethering of

 the breast on the chest wall, palpate for lumps, check for nipple discharge

 A suspicious lump or bloody nipple discharge MUST BE REFERRED for evaluation by mammography or ultrasonography as well as core needle biopsy

Mammography: a low-dose x-ray of the breast is the test of choice for screening of early breast cancer but it is available only at national referral hospital level.

Breast Ultrasound: not used as a screening test, but is useful as an additional tool in characterizing palpable tumors and taking of im age-directed biopsies. It may  be used as a screening tool in lactating women, small- breasted women and in males, and as diagnostic tests in symptomatic patients.

Screening for Cervical Cancer

This aims to detect pre-cancerous lesions that are then treated to prevent progression to invasive cancer. The following methods are recommended:

Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA): involves applying 3-5% freshly prepared acetic acid to the cervix and observing results after one minute.

 The  VIA  results  are  generally  categorized  into  3  subsets: suspicious for cancer, VIA negative and VIA positive

 It uses readily available equipment, does not require a

 laboratory and provides an immediate result.

 Positive cases can be treated with cryotherapy by adequately trained providers.

Consider the following if using VIA as a screening method:

 Women <25 years of age should be screened only if they are at  high  risk  for  disease:  HIV  positive,  early  sexual  exposure, multiple partners, previous abnormal screening results, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)

 VIA is not appropriate for women >50 years

 Screening is advised every 3-5 years in case of normal results, but  after  1  years  in  case  of  abnormal  results  and  treatment (cryotherapy) nd every year in HIV positive women.

 Visual Inspection with Lugol's Iodine (VILI): it involves looking at  the  cervix  with  the  naked  eye  or  low  magnification  after

12.3 Common Cancers

This section describes the signs and symptoms of common cancers in adults and children, and outline some of the investigations required. Health workers should suspect cancer if they observe any of these clinical features and refer patients to the cancer treatment centers (Uganda Cancer Institte and regional referral hospitals).

### 12.3.1 Common Cancers in Children

swabbing  with  Lugol's  iodine.  VILI  has  a  sensitivity  and specificity  of  about  92%  and  85%,  respectively.  Test  results are available immediately thereby decreasing loss to follow-up. Recommendations  and  timings  of  VIA  outlined  above  also apply to VILI.

 Cytology Testing by Pap Smear: it is a microscopic examination of  cells  scraped  from  the  opening  of  the  cervix.  The  PAP smear is best taken around mid-cycle. It should be postponed in  case  of  cervicitis  until  after treatment;  otherwise,  the  pus cells  obscure clarity of the smear and affect interpretation. It requires  histocytology            services  so  it  is  available  only  at referral facilities.

 HPV  DNA  testing  is  currently  being  piloted  as  a  standard screening test in Uganda.

Risk factors and mitigators

These factors increase pain perception:

~ Anxiety and depression, social abandonment

~ Insomnia

~ Lack of understanding of the problem

These factors decrease pain perception:

~ Relaxation, sleep

~ Relief of other symptoms

~ Explanation/understanding, venting feelings

13.1.1 Clinical Features and Investigations

Types of Pain

There are 2 types of pain that health workers need to be aware of:



[TABLE]
TYPE OF PAIN
FEATURES
Nociceptive Pain The pain pathways are intact. This kind of pain responds to the analgesic ladder
~ ~
Somatic Pain (from bones and muscles): described as aching/ throbbing Visceral Pain: described as colicky pain (for hollow viscera), pressure, cramp- ing and ache for solid viscera
Neuropathic Pain There is damage to nerves or the pathways. The pain responds only partially to the analgesic ladder and needs adjuvants of amitriptyline or phe- nytoin
~ ~
Described as burning, prickling, stinging, pins and needles, insects crawl- ing under skin, numbness, hypersensitivity, shooting, or electric shock
[/TABLE]



### 13.1.1 Clinical Features and Investigations

Clinical Investigation

It is important for health workers to conduct a thorough investigation of a patient indicating they are in pain. The following points can be used to guide the investigation:

~ Duration of pain

~ Severity: assess using the Numerical Rating Scale, where the patient grades his/her pain on a scale of 0 = no pain to 5

~ = worst pain ever experienced

~ Site and radiation

~ Nature (e.g., stabbing, throbbing, crushing, cramp-like)

~ Periodicity (constant or intermittent)

~ Relieving or aggravating factors

~ Accompanying symptoms

~ Ask the patient for a detailed history for each pain experienced, as there may be more than one type of pain and area experiencing pain

~ A targeted physical examination

### 13.1.2 Nociceptive Pain Management

13.1.2 Nociceptive Pain Management

There are two goals of pain management:

~ Diagnose and treat the disease causing the pain

~ Achieve total pain relief with minimal side-effects and enable the patient to live as normal a life as possible

~ Pain can be treated through use of medicines and/or nondrug treatment

Non pharmacological treatment of pain

Medicines-Based Treatment

The WHO Analgesic Ladder and the following tables describe the use of medicines to relieve pain based on the type and degree of pain.

General principles in use of opioids

~ Health  professionals  specially  trained  in  palliative  care should supervise management of chronic pain in advanced or incurable conditions (e.g., cancer, AIDS)

~ Morphine is usually the drug of choice for severe pain. Liquid morphine is available, easy to dose, and is well absorbed from the oral mucosae and can be dripped in the mouth of adults and children

~ In continuous pain, analgesics should be given:

 By the clock (i.e. according to a regular dose schedule)

 By the patient (i.e. self-administered)

 By the mouth (i.e. as oral dose forms)

~ Pain  is  better  controlled  using  regular  oral  doses  which control pain. If pain is not controlled, increase the 24-hour dose by 30-50%

 Repeated injections are not indicated

~ Consider extra doses when painful procedure is planned and for  breakthrough  pain.  If  using  breakthrough  doses regularly, then increase the regular dose!

~ Side effects are minor and well-manageable if careful dosing and titration are done

Cautions on use of opioids

Opioids need to be effectively managed and administered, considering the associated cautions and side effects below. r Do not use opioids in severe respiratory depression and

head injury

 Use with care in the following conditions

 Advanced  liver  disease  (but  can  be  used  in  hepatocellular carcinoma when titrated as above)

 Acute asthma

 Acute abdominal pain (can use while awaiting diagnostic tests; never leave the patient in pain)

 Hypothyroidism

 Renal failure (reduce starting dose and/or reduce dose frequency)

 Elderly or severely wasted patient (reduce starting dose

 and/or reduce dose frequency)

 Use  with  extreme  care  (i.e.,  start  with  small  doses  and  use small incremental increases) in:

 Recurrent or concurrent intake of alcohol or other CNS

 depressants

Management of Side Effects of Opioids

SIDE EFFECT

MANAGE AS:

Respiratory depression

 Rarely  occurs  if  small  oral  doses  are  used  and  gradually titrated to response

 Can occur when morphine used parenterally

 Reverse respiratory depression using naloxone 0.4-2 mg slow IV every

2-3  minutes  according  to response

Child : 0.01 mg/kg slow IV; repeat 0.1 mg/kg if no response

Constipation

 Give Bisacodyl 10-15 mg nocte to prevent constipation except if diarrhoea is present Child: 5 mg rectally

 Add liquid paraffin 10 ml once a day if bisacodyl is not enough

Nausea or Vomiting

 Usually occurs in first 5 days and is self-limiting

 Vomiting later on may be due to another cause

 Give anti-emetic (e.g.

 metoclopramide 10 mg

 every 8 hours for 3-5 days)

Child 9-18 yrs: 5 mg 8 hourly

Child 5-9 yrs: 2.5 mg 8 hourly

Child 3-9 yrs: 2-2.5 mg 8 hourly

Child 1-3 yrs: 1 mg 8 hourly

Child <1 yr: 100 micrograms per kg every 12 hours

### 13.1.3 Neuropathic Pain

13.1.3  Neuropathic Pain

Neuropathic pain occurs as a result of damage to nerve tissue. There are two clinical kinds of neuropathic pain, both elements may be combined:

~ Stabbing-type: pain in a nerve distribution with minimal pain in between (e.g. trigeminal neuralgia) but can occur with any nerve. Responds to Phenytoin

~ Paraesthesia  dysaesthesiae,  or  burning-type  pain:  (e.g. post-herpetic neuralgia). Responds well to small doses of Amitriptyline

#### Management

Referral criteria

~ If pain does not respond to above measures, refer to palliative care specialist

~ Refer for radiotherapy at national referral hospital for severe bone pain not responding to above medications

~ Refer for surgery if the cause of pain is amenable to surgery

Management

### 13.2.9 End of Life Care

13.2.9 End of Life Care

Care in the last days of life.

LOC

HC2

HC4

HC3

Clinical  Features

Clinical signs at of end of life include (should be considered in those with terminal conditions who have been gradually deteriorating):

~ Patient becomes bed-bound and is increasingly drowsy or in a semi-conscious state

~ Minimal oral intake; patient not managing oral medication and only able to take sips of fluid

~ The patient's condition is deteriorating rapidly (e.g. day by day or hour by hour)

~ Breathing becomes irregular +/- noisy (death rattle)

~ Changes in skin colour and/ or temperature

~ Limited attention span

#### Investigations

Investigations

 Exclude reversible problems (e.g. drug toxicity, infections, dehydration, biochemical abnormalities)

 Before ordering a test, always ask 'will this test change my management plan or the outcome for the patient?'

 It is important to weigh the benefit versus the burden in assessing an intervention, and/or management plan based on the clinical features exhibited by the patient



[TABLE]
TREATMENT
LOC
General principles of medicine treatment

Focus on giving medication that will improve the pa- tient's quality of life

Treat symptoms of discomfort as in sections above

If the patient is unable to swallow choose an appropriate route to give necessary medications (e.g., via NG tube, parenteral or rectally)

Subcutaneous (SC) is recommended when the enteral route is not possible. It is preferred over IV and IM access due to its reduced trauma and pharmacokinetics
HC2
[/TABLE]



#### Management

Management

#### TREATMENT

TREATMENT

LOC

 If repeated injections are anticipated or experienced, a butterfly needle can be inserted and used as a route for regular SC injections

 Consider prescribing medications pre-emptively (antic- ipatory) to combat developing symptoms

 Morphine concentrations can vary depending on the preparation used; remember that SC morphine  has  twice the  potency  of  oral  morphine

Hydration and nutrition

 Patients should eat and drink as they wish, and take sips of water as long as they are able

 Families should be educated that it is normal for patients to lose their appetite, have a sense of thirst and stop feeding towards the end of life.

 They should not feed patients if they are no longer able to swallow as this may cause choking and distress

 IV fluids at this stage will not prolong life or prevent thirst. Over-hydration is discouraged as it may contrib- ute to distressing respiratory secretions or generalised oedema; good regular mouthcare is the best way to keep the patient comfortable

 IV dextrose for calorie supplementation is unlikely to be of benefit

 If there is a reduced level of consciousness, patients should not be fed due to the risk of aspiration.

 Artificial nutrition is generally discouraged at the end of life

Supportive care

 Keep the patient clean and dry

 Regularly clean the mouth with a moist cloth wrapped round a spoon

 Prevent and manage pressure sores appropriately

 Manage any associated pain



[TABLE]
TREATMENT
LOC

The end of life is an emotional time for all involved and requires health care professionals to be considerate and compassionate. Take time to listen to the concerns of the patient and their family; break bad news sensitively

Encourage the family to be present, holding a hand or talking to the patient even if there is no visible re- sponse; the patient may be able to hear even if they cannot respond

Consider spiritual support

Consider the best place of death for the patient and their family; would discharging them to go home be best?

Family Planning (FP) 15

For further detailed information on Family Planning (FP) and Maternal Health, please refer to 'Procedure Manual for Family Planning and Maternal Health Service Delivery MOH, 2016'.

Family planning is a basic human right for an individual and couples to exercise control over their fertility, make informed decision on the number of children they want to have, plan pregnancies, and the space between pregnancies.

FP has health benefits for the mother and the children and economic benefits for the family and the country at large.

15.1  Key steps to be followed in provision of fp services Icd10 code: z10.0

Provide information about FP, including preconception care to different groups

Counsel clients at high risk of unwanted pregnancies to accept/ use FP services

Counsel clients to make informed choice of FP methods, including dual methods

Obtain and record client history

Perform a physical assessment

Perform a pelvic examination

Screen for cervical cancer and HIV

Manage client according to chosen FP method

### 15.1.1 Provide Information about FP

15.1.1   Provide Information about FP including Pre-ConceptionCare to Different Groups

The procedures used here are also used in the next step to recruit clients for FP and maternal health services in young child, antenatal, labour and delivery wards, outpatients, outreach, and postpartum clinics and in providing education on specific chosen FP methods.

The objective is to:

~ Create awareness

~ Disseminate  correct  information  to  influence  people  to change beliefs, attitudes and practices

~ Recruit new clients and offer several FP methods

15.1.2 Counsel High-Risk Clients

Risk factors to look out for in clients include:

~ Recent delivery/abortion

~ >4 pregnancies

~ >35 years old or <20 years old

~ Complicating medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease)

~ People living with HIV/AIDS

~ Having children with birth interval <2 years

~ Poor obstetric history, which is likely to recur in future pregnancies (e.g., postpartum haemorrhage, pre- eclampsia)

Identify eligible women (non-pregnant) while conducting clinics such as:

~ Young child clinics and paediatric wards

~ Maternity and postnatal clinics and wards

~ Outpatient clinics

### 15.1.2 Counsel High-Risk Clients

~ Youths and Adolescent centers

~ HIV/AIDS care centers/ ART clinics

~ Sexual Reproductive Health clinics (e.g. Cervical cancer, Post abortion care, Adolescent/Youth clinics)

~ Male clinics

~ Gender based violence clinics/ corners

You can also identify the eligible women while:

~ Conducting outreaches (Immunisation or Home visits)

Discuss with clients about reproductive choices and risk factors. Give special consideration to first time parents and adolescents in provision of appropriate information on sexuality, family planning and family planning services: types, benefits, availability and procedures.

15.1.3  Pre-Conception Care with Clients Who Desire to Conceive

Pre-conception care discussion topics for clients who desire to conceive include:

~ Pregnancy planning and appropriate contraception

~ Folic acid supplementation 3 months preceeding conception

~ Good diet, risk assessment and management of pre existing conditions and risk factors

~ Benefits of preconception care (e.g., prevention of unintended pregnancies, good maternal and foetal outcomes)

~ Screening for hereditary diseases e.g., sickle cell disease

~ Screening for STI, including HIV and hepatitis

### 15.1.4 Discuss with PLW HIV Special Consideration for HIV Transmission

15.1.4  Discuss with PLW HIV Special Consideration for HIV Transmission

Key areas for discussion include:

~ Prevention of HIV transmission to spouse and child

~ Safer sexual practices and safe conception

~ Education/counseling about perinatal transmission risk

~ Initiation or modification of ART considering toxicity

~ Evaluation of opportunistic infections and offering ummarizedn

~ Some ARV drugs may interact and reduce the effect of hormonal  contraceptives.  It  is  always  ummarize  to  use additional barrier methods (condoms), which also prevent STIs.

### 15.1.5 Educate and Counsel Clients to Make Informed Choice of FP Method

15.2  Overview Of Key Contraceptive Methods

The following sections contain an overview of mainstream contraceptive methods and how to manage side effects of each (in case they occur). Side effects are one of most common reasons why women stop using contraception, and the health worker should be able to counsel the patient and address her concerns appropriately.

### 15.2.1 Condom (Male)

Methods all couples (except a few) can safely use

Emergency contraceptive pill (for emergency use only) Bilateral Tubal Ligation (BTL) and Vasectomy

Barrier methods (condoms, diaphragm) Lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM)

Fertility awareness (FAM) and Standard days methods

15.2.1 Condom (Male) ICD10 CODE: Z30.018/Z30.49

For example no-logo donation condoms, branded condoms.

Indications

~ Couples needing an immediately effective method

~ Where this is preferred FP method by client

~ Couples waiting to rule out suspected pregnancy

~ Protection against exposure to STIs including HIV/AIDS



[TABLE]
Category
Conditions
thyroid disorders, tuberculosis (non-pelvic), uncompli- cated heart disease, viral hepatitis (carrier or chronic), cholecystitis, gall stones
Others
Adolescents, breast cancer family history, venous thromboembolism (VTE) family history, high risk for HIV, surgery without prolonged immobilisation, taking antibiotics (except rifampicin or rifabutin)
[/TABLE]



~ Where  back-up  method  is  needed,  e.g.  when  womanis starting or has forgotten to take oral contraceptives

~ Couples  where  one  or  both  partners  have  HIV/AIDS, even if using another FP method

Advantages

~ Male plays role in FP

~ Protects against unwanted pregnancy

~ Also protects against STIs and HIV infection

Disadvantages

~ Some  men  may  have  difficulty  maintaining  an  erection with condom on

~ May cause insensitivity of the penis

~ Occasional hypersensitivity to latex or lubricants (may result in a severe allergic reaction)

~ Requires correct use with every act of sex for greatest effectiveness

#### Management

### 15.2.9 Natural FP: Cervical Mucus Method (CMM) and Moon Beads

MANAGEMENT OF SIDE EFFECTS OF IUD

Irregular Bleeding

Assess for pregnancy/abortion:

~ Reassure  that  many  women  using  IUD  get  irregular bleeding. It is not harmful and should lessen or stop after several months of use

If bleeding continues:

 Give 400-800 mg ibuprofen  eight hourly after meals for 5 days when irregular bleeding starts

 Tranexamic acid 500mg 8hourly 5-7days

 Check for anaemia and treat accordingly

If irregular bleeding persists:

 Investigate other reasons (unrelated to IUD) and treat accordingly

 Help client choose another FP method if necessary

Heavy Bleeding

Assess for pregnancy/abortion:

 Give ibuprofen 400-800 mg every eight hours after meals for 5 days

 Or tranexamic acid 1500 mg every eight hours for 3 days, then 1000 mg once daily for two days

 Give ferrous salt tablets (60 mg iron) to prevent anaemia

 Educate on nutrition

If bleeding persists:

 Investigate other reasons (unrelated to IUD) and treat accordingly

 Help client choose another FP method if necessary

15.2.9    Natural FP: Cervical Mucus Method (CMM) and Moon Beads ICD10 CODE: Z30.02

CMM is a fertility awareness-based method of FP which relies on the change in  the  nature  of  vaginal  mucus  during the  menstrual  cycle  in  order to  detect  the  fertile  time.  During this  time,  the  couple  avoids  pregnancy  by changing  sexual behaviour  as  follows:

### 15.2.10 Natural FP: Lactational Amenorrhoea Method (LAM)

15.2.10  Natural FP: Lactational Amenorrhoea Method (LAM) ICD10 CODE: Z30.02

LAM relies on the suppression of ovulation through exclusive breastfeeding as a means of contraception. Guidance  on  correct  use  of  the  method is  only  available at  centres  with  trained  service  providers.  LAM  requires  3 conditions  which  must  ALL  be  met:

 The mother's monthly bleeding has not returned

 The baby is fully or nearly fully breastfed; and is fed often, day and night

 The baby is less than 6 months old

#### Management

~ Abstaining from sexual intercourse: Avoiding vaginal sex completely (also called periodic abstinence)

~ Using barriers methods, e.g., condoms, cervical caps

~ Guidance on correct use of the method is only available at centres with specially trained service providers.

16.1  ANTENATAL CARE (ANC) ICD10 CODE: Z36

Antenatal care is a planned programme of medical care offered to pregnant women by a skilled birth attendant, from the time of conception to delivery, aimed at ensuring a safe and satisfying pregnancy and birth outcome.

The main objective of antenatal care is to give information on:

~ Screening, prevention, and treatment of complications

~ Emergency preparedness

~ Birth planning

~ Satisfying  any  unmet  nutritional,  social,  emotional,  and physical needs of the pregnant woman

~ Provision of patient education, including successful care and nutrition of the newborn

~ Identification of high-risk pregnancy

~ Encouragement of male partner involvement in antenatal care

### 16.1.1 Goal-Oriented Antenatal Care Protocol

16.1.1    Goal-Oriented Antenatal Care Protocol

Important: Goals are different depending on the timing of the visit. 4 visits are aimed for in an uncomplicated pregnancy.

If a woman books later than in first trimester, preceding goals should be combined and attended to.  At all visits address any identified problems, check the BP and measure the Symphysio-Fundal Height (SFH). All women must receive Hb, HIV testing and Syphilis testing (RPR) routinely.

#### TREATMENT

TREATMENT

LOC

Principles of management

 Early identification of high risk pregnant women and referral as appropriate

 Preconception care and folic acid supplementation

 Prophylaxis and antenatal counselling will prevent some HRPs

 Early start of antenatal care

 Close medical supervision during pregnancy

 Special investigations to evaluate foetal development and maternal well-being

 Birth preparedness plan

 Timely intervention for therapy and delivery

 Skilled birth attendance

 Early referral to higher level as appropriate

HC3 HC4

Note : Skilled attendance at birth remains the most important com- ponent of comprehensive emergency obstetric and new-born care.

16.2  MANAGEMENT OF SELECTED CONDITIONS IN PREGNANCY

#### Causes

Causes

~ Nutritional causes; iron deficiency, folic acid deficiency

~ Infections and infestations; hookworm infestation, malaria, UTI, HIV/AIDS

~ Haemorrhagic causes: bleeding in pregnancy, trauma

~ Haemoglopathies eg. Sickle cell anaemia, thalassemias

~ Malignancies

~ Due to medications from HIV /Cancer treatment

~ Any other causes

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

Mother may give history of

~ Gradual onset of exhaustion or weakness

~ Swelling of the legs

~ Dyspnoea, dizziness, and palpitations

On examination

~ Pallor  of  the  conjunctiva,  tongue,  palm,  vagina,  etc.,  of varying degree, depending on the severity of anaemia

~ Oedema of the legs

~ In very severe cases: evidence of heart failure such as engorged neck veins, dyspnoea, hepatomegally, ascites, gallop rhythm, and oedema

#### Complications

Complications

~ Untreated  anaemia  may  increase  the  risk  of  premature labour, poor intrauterine foetal growth, weak uterine contractions, foetal hypoxia, postpartum haemorrhage, poor lactation, post-partum sepsis

#### Investigations

Investigations

 Blood

 Hb (<11 g/dL is considered abnormal)

 Peripheral smear to determine the type of anaemia and presence of malaria parasites

 HB electrophoresis

Pregnant women with chronic hypertension should continue to follow the lifestyle modifications for controlling hypertension such as:

~ No alcohol

~ Regular moderate exercise, brisk walking for 30 minutes at least 3 times a week

~ Smoking cessation.

Health worker should:

~ Ask mother about foetal movements at each visit

~ Aim for BP <140/90 mmHg

~ Consider  labour  if  BP  is  persistently  ³160/90  mmHg, pregnancy ³37 weeks gestation, and if there is maternal or foetal compromise, e.g. poor SFH growth

#### Management

~ If a mother chooses to feed the newborn on replacement feeding  from  the  beginning,  the  choice  of  replacement feeds should fulfil the AFASS Criteria (Affordable, Feasible, Available, Sustainable and Safe).

### 16.2.4 Malaria in Pregnancy

16.2.4   Malaria in Pregnancy ICD10 CODE: B54

Malaria can contribute to pregnancy complications such as abortion, poor foetal mental development, premature labour, intrauterine growth retardation and foetal death, severe maternal anaemia due to haemolysis, and death.

Complications are more common in mothers of low gravidity (primi- and secundigravidae), HIV positivity, adolescent age, sickle-cell disease, and those from areas of low endemicity,e.g. in Kisoro and Kabale.

. see section 2.5.2 for more information on features and diagnosis of malaria

### 16.2.5 Diabetes in Pregnancy

~ Give  all  pregnant  women  intermittent  preventive  treatment (IPTp) with sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) - Except in allergy to sulphonamide

~ Prompt  diagnosis  and  effective  treatment  of  malaria  in pregnancy

Education messages to mothers and the community

~ Malaria is transmitted by female anopheles mosquitoes

~ Pregnant women and children are at particular risk of malaria

~ If untreated, malaria can cause severe anaemia and death in pregnant women

~ Malaria can lead to anaemia, miscarriage, stillbirth, mentally-retarded children, or low birth weight children, who are more prone to infant/childhood mortality compared to normal weight children

~ It is better and cheaper to prevent than to treat malaria

~ The individual, family, and the community can control malaria by taking appropriate actions

~ Sleeping under an insecticide-treated mosquito netis the best way to prevent malaria

~ It is very important to complete the course of treatment in order to achieve a cure

~ Severe  complicated  malaria  needs  special  management, therefore refer

 Pregnancy test (to exclude other causes)

 Complete blood count, blood grouping and cross-matching

### 16.3.4 Premature Rupture of Membranes (PROM & PPROM)

16.3.4  Premature Rupture of Membranes (PROM & PPROM) ICD10 CODE: O42

PROM is a rupture of membranes before the start of labour. It can occur either:

-When foetus is mature/term at or after 37 weeks (PROM)

-Or  when  foetus  is  immature/preterm  between  24-37 weeks of gestation. This is referred to as Pre-term PROM (PPROM).

In all cases of PPROM, prematurity and its attendant problems are the principal concerns for the foetus, while infection morbidity and its complications are the primary concerns for the mother.

Risk factors associated with PPROM

Low socioeconomic status, tobacco use

 Low body mass index

 Prior history of PV bleeding during pregnancy

 History of preterm labour

 Urinary tract infection, chorioamnionitis

 Cervical cerclage, amniocentesis

Clinical features associated with PROM

 Leakage of fluid or vaginal discharge

 May be with or without vaginal bleeding

 Pelvic pressure but no contractions

 If ROM has been prolonged, the patient may present with fever, abdominal pain, and a foul smelling vaginal  discharge

Investigation

 Th e typical odour of amniotic fluid is diagnostic

 Place a vaginal pad over the vulva; examine visually and by smell after 1 hour

 Use a high-level disinfected or sterile speculum for vagina

 examination: fluid may be seen coming from the cervix or forming a pool in the posterior fornix

 Ask patient to cough: this may cause a gush of fluid

 If membrane rupture is not recent or leakage is gradual, confirming the diagnosis may be difficult

 Abdominal US scan may show absence of or very low

 amounts of amniotic fluid

 If available, do Nitrazine test and Ferning test

Caution

 Do NOT do digital vaginal examination - it does not help diagnosis and may cause infection

Management of PROM (>37 weeks)

 Over 90% of patients with PROM go into spontaneous labour within 24 hours

 Expectant management carries a risk of infection

 Induction of labour decreases the risk of infection without increasing the C/S delivery rate

 Expectant management also carries a risk of neonatal issues, e.g., infection, abruptio placenta, foetal distress, foetal restriction deformities, and death

Management of PPROM (<37 weeks)

 The primary determinant of neonatal morbidity and mortality is gestational age at delivery, hence stressing the need for conservative management whenever possible for Pre-PROM

 All patients with Pre-PROM should receive antenatal steroids for foetal lung maturity

 All patients with PPROM should receive prophylactic antibiotics since there is a high risk of infection

 Administration of tocolytics for 48 hours may allow administration of steroids to accelerate lung maturity

 In general, prognosis is good after 34 weeks of gestation

 All patients with PPROM should be cared for in a facility where a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is available

16.3.7      Pre-Eclampsia ICD10 CODE: O14

Pre-eclampsia is a hypertensive condition of pregnancy usually diagnosed after 20 weeks of gestation and can present as late as 4-6 weeks postpartum.

It is haracterized with hypertension, proteinuria with or without oedema and, may result into maternal fits if not managed appropriately.

It may also be superimposed on chronic hypertension. It is classified as mild to severe pre-eclampsia.

Clinical features of severe pre-eclampsia

### 16.3.8 Eclampsia

16.3.8       Eclampsia

Occurrence of generalised tonic-clonic seizures after 20 weeks of pregnancy, associated with hypertension and proteinuria, without any other neurological cause of seizures.

Principles of Management

Eclampsia is a medical emergency and should be referred to hospital urgently, after first aid measures as available.

Goals of treatment are:

 Controlling/preventing convulsions

 Controlling blood pressure

 Delivering the baby as soon as possible



[TABLE]
TREATMENT
LOC
First aid


16.4 LABOUR, DELIVERY AND ACUTE COMPLICATIONS

ICD10 CODE: O80

### 16.4.1 Normal Labour and Delivery

16.4.1     Normal Labour and Delivery

Labour is a physiological process by which the uterus expels the foetus Prevention

 Regular attendance of good antenatal care with a skilled birth attendant, and checking of blood pressure and urine protein.

and other products of conception. Labour can last from between 6 to 18 hours; being longer for first pregnancies.

Normal labour is characterized by:

 Onset of regular uterine contractions at term

 Progressive cervical dilatation

 Expulsion of the foetus

FIRST STAGE OF LABOUR

 From onset of labour to full dilation of the cervix

 The presenting part descends well into the midpelvis

What to do

 Provide rapid counselling and testing for HIV if it was not done during prenatal period

 Make correct diagnosis of labour

 Open a partogram for the patient and monitor progress of labour

 Vaginal examinations every 2 to 4 hours. Expected rate of cer- vical dilatation is at least 1 cm/hour. Examine every hour once an 8 cm dilatation has been reached

 Observe change of shape of foetal head (moulding), foetal position, and caput. Descent is assessed by abdominal palpation noting how much of the head you can feel above the pelvis

 Check uterine contractions

 Hourly monitoring of mother's BP, temperature, pulse and res- piration. Check ketones and proteins in urine, and Hb

 Check foetal heart rate (FHR) for 1 minute every 30 minutes. A normal FHR is 120 to 160 beats per minute; FHR >160 or <120 beats per minute indicates foetal distress

 Observe state of membranes and colour of amniotic fluid if membranes are ruptured

Hydration and nourishment

 Ensure oral or IV fluid intake especially in prolonged labour, to avoid dehydration and ketosis

 Give normal saline and Dextrose solution as required

Analgesia

 Provide appropriate analgesia if desired by the patient e.g. morphine 10 mg IM stat at 4-6 cm dilatation

2ND STAGE OF LABOUR

 From full dilatation to expulsion of the foetus

 Contractions become strong and frequent

 Patient bears down

 Perineum bulges and overlying skin becomes tense and shiny

What to do

 Ensure full dilatation of the cervix by vaginal examination

 Encourage the mother to bear down with contractions, and relax in between

 Protect the perineum from tearing by supporting with fingers at crowning

 Do an epsiotomy under local anaesthesia if required

 Allow the baby's head to rest when it is born and loose cord from around the neck if present. If cord is too tight, clamp it with two artery forceps and cut it.

 Support the head during delivery. Anterior shoulder is delivered first followed by posterior.

 Place the baby on mother's abdomen or arms. Dry the baby, wipe eyes

 If baby not crying, assess breathing. Rub the back 2-3 times. If not breathing resuscitate (see section 16.5.1)

 After the baby is born, palpate mother's abdomen to exclude second baby

 Then give Oxytocin 10 IU IM to the mother

 Clamp the cord and cut it (1-3 minutes after birth)

3RD STAGE OF LABOUR

~ From delivery of the baby to delivery of the placenta

What to do: Child

 Evaluate baby's condition using APGAR (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration) score, and record in the baby's chart. Resuscitate if necessary

 Give 1 mg IM stat of phytomenadione (Vitamin K) to baby

 Clean the eyes with sterile warm water and apply tetracycline eye ointment to baby's eyes as prophylaxis against ophthalmia neonatorum

 Give identification tag to baby, wrap in warm towels and give to the mother to introduce breast feeding

 Weigh the baby and compare with chart

 Give a full physical examination to the baby f Immunize the baby

What to do: Mother

 Exami ne fundal height and palpate uterus lightly to determine whether it has contracted well and to exclude undiagnosed twins

 Ensure oxytocin 10 IU IM was given

 Await strong contraction (2-3 minutes) and deliver the placenta by controlled cord traction. Deliver the

 placenta and examine it for completeness and normalcy. Weigh the placenta. If placenta is not delivered within 30 minutes, see Retained Placenta section 16.4.5

 Massage lower abdomen lightly to stimulate contraction and expel clots

 Examine the perineum, vagina, and cervix for tears.

 Repair episiotomy and any tears immediately

 Observe for 1 to 2 hours. Monitor BP, temperature, and pulse rate hourly. Also do uterine palpation, vulva inspection and estimation of degree of blood loss

 Refer to postnatal ward

### 16.4.2 Induction of Labour

16.4.2    Induction of Labour

Induction of labour may be indicated for medical reasons, like, pre-ec- lampsia, diabetes, post-term pregnancy.

However, possible risks of induction are:

 Failed induction

 Hyperstimulation syndrome, requiring emergency caesarean section.

Induction is contraindicated in para 5 and above and in patients with a previous scar. In these cases there is indication for caesarean section.

TREATMENT

LOC

If >4 contractions in 10 minutes, or contraction longer than 60 secs or foetal distress:

 Stop rate of infusion

 Give salbutamol 5 mg in RL or NS 500 mL IV infusion at 10 drops/minute

 Monitor foetal heart rate

Cervix not favourable

 Ripen cervix using either

 Misoprostol 25 micrograms inserted vaginally every 6 hours for 2 doses, if no response increase to 50 micrograms every 6 hours, max 200 micrograms in 24 hours - stop when in established labour

 Or misoprostol 20 micrograms orally (dissolve 1 200 microgram tablet in 200 mL of water and give 20 mL) every 2 hours until labour starts or max 24 hours

H

 Or Foley catheter: insert Foley catheter through internal cervical os under sterile technique, inflate bulb with 50 mL of water, and tape catheter under light traction, leave it until contraction begins or up to 12 hours

 If cervical ripening, proceed to cesarean section

 If cervix ripens but labour does no start, start oxytocin induction

Caution

 Do not start  oxytocin  within  8  hours  of  using misoprostol

 Carefully control oxytocin infusion - do not give rapidly

 Monitor  uterine  contractions  and  foetal  heart rate closely

 If foetal distress, do emergency cesarean section

#### TREATMENT

TREATMENT

LOC

Cervix favourable in HIV and Hep B negative mothers



Artifically rupture the membranes (with amniotic hook

or Kocher clamp) followed 2 hours later by

 Oxytocin IV 2.5 IU in 500 mL of Normal saline.

 Start with 10 drops/minute

 Increase infusion rate by 10 drops every 30 minutes (max 60 minutes) until good contraction pattern is established (3-5 contractions in 10 minutes each last- ing >40 secs), and maintain until delivery is complete



If no good contraction pattern with 60 drops/ minute,

increase oxytocin concentration to 5 IU in 500 mL of

Dextrose or Normal saline at 30 drops/minute, increase

by 10 drops every 30 minutes until maximum of 60

drops/minute

 ONLY IN PRIMIGRAVIDA: if no good contraction pattern established, increase concentration of oxytocin to 10 IU in 500 mL and repeat as above (from 30 to 60 drops/minute)

 DO NOT USE 10 IU in 500 mL in MULTIGRAVIDA or WOMEN WITH PREVIOUS CAESAREAN SECTION

 Refer other cases or primigravida not responding to the higher concentration for surgical management

 NEVER LEAVE THE WOMAN ALONE

### 16.4.3 Obstructed Labour

16.4.3      Obstructed Labour

ICD10 CODE: O64-O66

Failure of labour to progress despite good uterine contractions.

#### Causes

Causes

 Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD)

 Large baby

 Foetal abnormalities: hydrocephalus, conjoined twins

 Small or deformed pelvis

 Malpresentation: the presenting part of the foetus is not the head, e.g. breech presentation, shoulder presentation, face, etc

 Malposition: an abnormal position of the foetal head when this is the presenting part, e.g. occipito-posterior

 Any barrier that prevents the baby's descent down the birth canal

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

 Contractions are strong but no evidence of descent of the presenting part

 Malposition or malpresentation may be felt on abdominal examination

 In a first delivery, the pains will just stop spontaneously

 Foetal distress with meconium stained liqour

 Fever and dehydration with maternal exhaustion

 In late stages, the regular colicky strong pains may stop when the uterus is ruptured, and be replaced by a dull continuous pain

 Signs of shock if the uterus has ruptured

 Bleeding from the genital tract which may be a gush of blood or a small but persistent trickle of blood (>1 pad soaked in five minutes)

 The uterus may still be large, soft, and not contracted escially in primary PPH

 If uterus is well contracted, look for tears on the perineum, vagina, cervix, or uterus

 Signs of shock may be present: tachycardia, low BP, cold and clammy skin

 In secondary PPH, there may be signs of infection, e.g., fever, abdominal tenderness

Investigations

 Hb and blood group should have been already done and recorded during ANC; if not, do them urgently

 Women at high risk of PPH should have blood cross- matched and at least 2 units booked

16.5  ESSENTIAL CARE OF THE NEWBORN

### 16.5.1 Newborn Resuscitation

16.5.1      Newborn Resuscitation ICD10 CODE: P22

Start resuscitation within one minute of birth if baby is not breathing or is gasping for breath

 Observe universal hygiene precautions to prevent infection

 Prepare for resuscitation at each delivery even where there are no signs of foetal distress, just in case the baby requires it

Minimum preparation for every birth

Ensure that the following equipment is available and in good working order:

 Two warm cotton cloths and a small one to position the head

 Heat source to keep the baby warm

 Mucus extractor such as a penguin sucker (or bulb syringe)

 Ambu bag and new-born masks of varying sizes (0 and 1), pulse oximeter

 Clock or watch

 A birth attendant skilled in new-born resuscitation



[TABLE]
TREATMENT
LOC

Advise on postpartum care and hygiene

Advise mother on breast care; wear a firm bra, do not express the breasts

Give paracetamol if breasts are painful

You may give lactation suppression drugs such as

bromocriptine 2.5 mg once a day for 2 weeks

Counsel on appropriate family planning
HC3
[/TABLE]



#### MANAGEMENT

MANAGEMENT

LOC



Keep the baby warm by drying the baby using the first cotton

cloth and change to the second dry cotton cloth. Rub the back

2-3 times

-

Clamp and cut the cord if necessary

-

Transfer the baby to a dry clean warm surface

-

Tell  the  mother  that  the  baby  is  having  difficulty

starting to breathe and that you will help the baby



Open the airway

-

Position the head so that it is slightly extended

-

Place a folded towel <2 cm thick under baby's shoulders

-

Suction if secretions in mouth or nose and if baby

-

born through meconium stained amniotic fluid:

HC3

suction  5  cm  in  the  mouth,  3  cm  in  the  nose  while

withdrawing, for max 10 seconds in total.

-

Do not suction too deep into the throat as this may

cause the heart to slow down or breathing to stop



If still not breathing, SELECT APPROPRIATE MASK SIZE

TO COVER CHIN, MOUTH AND NOSE, AND VENTILATE

-

Form a seal with mask covering chin, mouth and nose

-

Squeeze bag 5 times

-

Observe chest

If not rising

-

Reposition head, check mask seal, squeeze bag harder



Once good seal and chest rising, ventilate for one minute at 40

squeezes per minute then stop and look for breathing

Check for hypertension

If breathing >30/minute and no severe chest in- drawing

 Stop ventilating

 Put baby skin-to-skin on mother's chest



Observe every 15 minutes for breathing and warmth:

take temperature, count breaths, observe for chest-in-

drawing or grunting respiration.

 Monitor SpO2

MANAGEMENT

LOC

If breathing >30/minute and no severe chest in- drawing

 Stop ventilating

 Put baby skin-to-skin on mother's chest

 Observe every 15 minutes for breathing and warmth: take temperature, count breaths, observe for chest-in- drawing or grunting respiration.

 Monitor SpO2

 Encourage mother to breastfeed within one hour

 DO NOT LEAVE THE BABY ALONE

If breathing <30/minute or severe chest in-drawing

 Continue ventilating f Arrange for immediate referral

 Give oxygen if  available f Reassess every 1-2 minutes

 Continue to ventilate during referral

If not gasping or breathing at all after 20 minutes of ventilation

 Stop ventilation, the baby is dead

Notes

 Room air is sufficient in the absence of oxygen

 Cardiac massage is RARELY required; it is dangerous when done incorrectly. A slow heart rate almost always responds to good breathing assistance only

 Usually, there is no need for drugs if prompt and sufficient ventilation is provided

Harmful and ineffective resuscitation practices

 Routine suction of new-born's mouth and nose as soon as the head is born

 Stimulation of the new-born by slapping or flicking the soles of the feet

### 16.5.2 General Care of Newborn After Delivery

 Postural drainage (putting the baby upside down) and slapping the back

 Squeezing the back to remove secretions from airway

 Routine giving of sodium bicarbonate to new-borns who are not breathing.

 Intubation by an unskilled person

16.6   POSTPARTUM CONDITIONS

### 16.6.1 Postpartum Care

16.6.1    Postpartum Care ICD10 CODE: Z39

The postpartum period, also known as the puerperium, begins with the delivery of the baby and placenta, up to six weeks after delivery.

Healthcare providers should be aware of the medical and psychological needs of the postpartum mother, and sensitive to cultural differences that surround childbirth, which may involve eating particular foods and restricting certain activities.

Postpartum care services

The mother and baby should be seen at 6 hours after birth and again before discharge if in a health facility (and anytime the mother reports concern about herself and her baby) or approximately 6 hours after delivery at home.

The routine follow-up visits are at 6 days and 6 weeks, and have the following components:

 Counselling

 Assessment and management of observed or reported problems. Check for hypertension, anaemia, vaginal bleeding and discharge, uterine infection, puerperal fever, malaria, UTI, urine dribbling, pus or perineal pain, postpartum depression, breast problems, HIV and any other complaint

#### 16.6.1.1 Postpartum Counselling

Note:

 Small babies need specially careful attention

 Wash hands before and after baby care

16.6.1.1   Postpartum Counselling

Provide the following counselling at all postpartum visits.

General counselling

 Breastfeeding/breast care

 Nutrition, ferrous and folic acid supplements, avoid alcohol and tobacco

Complications and danger signs for the mother

 Danger signs (see next table)

 Readiness plan in case of an emergency

-Advise her to have someone near for at least 24 hours after delivery to respond to any change in condition

-Discuss emergency issues with her and partner/family:

-Where to go if danger signs appear, how to get there, costs involved, family/community support

-Advise her to seek help from the community if needed

-Advise her to bring any home-based maternal record to the health facility, even for an emergency visit

 Self care and other good health practices, personal hygiene, handwashing, genital hygiene (care of the episiotomy or repaired tears)

 Pelvic floor exercises

 Sleeping under mosquito nets

 Postpartum checks (6 days and 6 weeks)

 Provide information on bonding by encouraging the mother to hold, touch, explore her baby as well as rooming-in (mother and baby sleeping in the same bedHIV testing

 Discuss with the couple the need for shared care of the newborn

 Help build confidence by providing reassurance that the woman is capable of caring for the newborn

Counselling on baby care

 Hygiene and care of the baby, (see previous sections)

 Danger signs for the baby

 Immunization schedule

 Let baby sleep on the back or side

 Ensure the baby is kept warm without overcovering

 Apply chlorhexidine digluconate gel to the cord stump daily after every bath until the cord falls off. Provide the gel to the mother, and teach her how to use it while at home

 Keep baby away from smoke and smokers

 Keep baby (especially if small) away from anyone whois ill

 Do not share supplies (for example, clothing, feeding utensils) with other babies

Advise mother on danger signs as follows:



[TABLE]
TYPE OF DANGER SIGN
ACTION TO TAKE

Vaginal bleeding (>2 pads soaked in 30 minutes after delivery or bleeding increases instead of dcreases after delivery)

Fever or convulsions

Fast or difficult breathing

Too weak to get out of bed
Go to health facility immediately

Severe abdominal pain

Severe headache/blurred vision

Pain in the calf (ankle) muscles
[/TABLE]



### 16.6.2 Postnatal Depression

16.6.2     Postnatal Depression

Condition characterized by persistent low mood developing during the puerperium period, usually 1 or 2 weeks following delivery. It needs specialized assessment and treatment.

Mild depressive symptoms (sadness, tearfulness, irritability, anxiety) develop commonly during the first week after the delivery but resolve within 2 weeks ('baby blues'): it usually needs ONLY counseling and support.

#### Risk factors

Risk factors

 Previous psychiatric history

 Recent stressful events

 Young age, first baby (primigravida) and associated fear of the responsibility for the new baby

 Poor marital relationship, poor social support

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

Management

### 16.6.4 Obstetric Fistula

16.6.4       Obstetric Fistula

Obstetric fistula is an abnormal communication between the birth canal, and either the bladder, ureters, or rectum. It is one of the major causes of maternal morbidity making the women with the condition suffer from constant urinary incontinence which can lead to skin infections, kidney disorder or death if left untreated.

#### Prevention

Prevention

 Proper attachment of baby on the breast

 Frequent emptying of the breast

 Ensure the baby is sucking on the areolar and not the nipple

 Manage breast engorgement if not breastfeeding, or lost baby (Refer to section on care of the mother and baby immediately after delivery)

ICD10 CODE: 071

#### Causes

Causes

 Obstructed labour (main cause): most fistula develops in 2 weeks after an obstructed labour, causing an often expansive crush injury to the vaginal tissues

 Sexual abuse and rape (Gender-based violence)

 Complication of unsafe abortion

 Surgical trauma usually following a caesarean section

 Gynaecological cancers and radiotheraphy

Predisposing factors

 Lack of access to maternity care

 Lack of/inadequate skilled care at birth

 Lack of facilities for ANC and childbirth

 Lack of knowledge to identify danger signs and promptly respond

 Poverty and lack of women empowerment

 Early marriage and childbirth

#### Clinical features

 Inadequate family planning access

 Harmful traditional practices such as Female Genital Mutilation

Clinical features

 Unncontrolled leakage of urine or faeces from vagina

#### Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis

 Stress, urge or overflow incontinence

 Ureterovaginal fistula (UVF)

#### Investigations

Investigations

 Speculum examination to visualise leakage; site, size and amount

 Confirm by dye test on pelvic examination/speculum examination, and/or examination under anaesthesia (EUA)

#### Management

Management

A fundamental part of the management of obstetric fistula is the appropriate standard management of ALL women who have survived prolonged or obstructed labour, since it can prevent fistula formation and cure small ones.

Aims of management are to:

 Prevent fistula formation

 Close the fistula

 Make the woman continent and able to resume a full and active life

Principles of immediate care of women who have survived prolonged/ obstructed labour, or who present immediately after delivery with obstetric fistula



[TABLE]
TREATMENT
LOC

Insert appropriate sized (Foley size 16-18) catheter and leave in situ

Refer for follow-up care:
-
The vagina should be examined by speculum as soon as possible and necrotic tissue gently excised under aseptic conditions
- 
Repeat this until vagina is clean The mother can be discharged with the catheter and advised on care and to come back for review and/or removal

Recommend increase in fluid intake up to 5 litres a day

Perineal Sitz or salt baths twice daily to help the peri- neum to heal

Treat any intercurrent infection and give prophylaxis against UTI:
- 
Nitrofurantoin 100 mg 1 tablet in the evening Remove the catheter:
-
After 2 weeks, only if no damage is shown to have occurred
-
After 4-6 weeks in case of small fistula

After removing the catheter, if there is no evidence of fistula, discharge with the following advice:
-
Avoid sexual intercourse for 3 months. Once it has resumed, it should be gentle and with consideration for the woman
-
Avoid pregnancy for about 6 months to one year
HC3 HC4
-
Advise on family planning/contraception and spacing of children, and the importance of good ANC during her next pregnancy
-
All future babies should be delivered in a unit equipped to undertake caesarean section
[/TABLE]



Management of women who presents with an established obstetric /uniFB01stula

These are women in whom the conservative management described above failed or they presented with an established fistula.

Prevention

 Provide skilled attendance at births and improve on emergency obstetric care at all levels

 Increase access to accurate and quality family planning information and services, especially for adolescents

 Establish appropriate and effective referral system at all levels (early referrals)

ENSURE ALL WOMEN WHO HAVE SUFFERED OBSTRUCTED LABOUR ARE MANAGED ACCORDING TO THE STANDARD MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL FOR FISTULA PREVENTION



[TABLE]
TREATMENT
LOC
 Refer to regional level for assessment and appropriate management  Each woman who has been successfully repaired should receive a card with details of her history, a diagram of the injury and a summary of the operation done which should be presented to every health worker wherever she may go for care

16.7 INTRAUTERINE FETAL DEMISE (IUFD) OR FETAL DEATH IN UTERO (FDIU)

FISTULA PREVENTION

Fetal demise (fetal death) refers to situations in which the fetus is no longer alive, but the uterus has not yet started to expel its contents and the cervical os remains closed.  Intrauterine fetal demise or death refers to babies with no signs of life in utero. 'early IUFD' refers to fetal demise before 20 weeks' gestation and IUFD for demise of a fetus at 20 weeks gestation through to term.

### Causes

Causes

~ Birth defects (congenital abnormalities of the fetus)

~ Blood transfer from baby to mother (feto-maternal hemorrhage)

~ Maternal or fetal infection

~ Genetic abnormality of the fetus

~ Placenta separated from the inner uterine wall (placental abruption)

~ Umbilical cord issues

~ Uterine ruptur e

### Prevention:

Prevention:

This should be done during antenatal and intrapartum to reduce fetal death

~ Detection and treatment of syphilis/ Malaria

~ Detection  and  management  of  hypertensive  disease  of pregnancy

~ Management of sickle cell disease

~ Detection and management of diabetes

~ Monitoring during labour

### Diagnosis:

Diagnosis:

 vaginal bleeding

 Absence or cessation of fetal movements-the usual reason for consultation.

 A uterus that is significantly smaller than the expected size i.e., fundal height too small for gestational age or decrease in fundal height from a prior visit.

 Absence of fetal heart sounds on electronic auscultation

 Sometimes, breast engorgement, indicating the end of the pregnancy.

 The above signs suggest fetal death but are not sufficiently sensitive to justify a hasty, rash decision. Errors are common. Repeat the exam, do not rush.

 Ultrasonography paired with indicative clinical findings is essential for the accurate diagnosis/ confirmation of Intra-uterine Fetal Death (IUFD)

Common etiologies of IUFD <28weeks gestation:

 Infection or other medical conditions

 Placental abruption or insufficiency/Intrauterine growth restriction

 Congenital malformations of the fetus

 Umbilical cord accidents or other complications

Medical management of IUFD ( ≥ 14 to ≤ 28 weeks)

 IUFD may be managed expectantly or treated surgically (D&E) or medically (with medications).

 Discussions aim to foster shared decision making about the plan for care and support maternal/parental choice.

 Supportive social and psychological care should be made available to all bereaved parents

 a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol should be the first-line intervention:

Mifepristone (200mg) administered orally followed 1-2 days later by repeat doses of 400 µg misoprostol administered sublingually or vaginally every 4-6 hours. The minimum recommended interval between use of mifepristone and misoprostol is 24 hours. Between 24 and 48 hours of mifepristone (200mg), the four tablets of misoprostol should be given vaginally, sublingually and can be administered by physician, midwife or woman herself.

Alternative regimens: repeat doses of 400 µg misoprostol administered sublingually or vaginally every 4-6 hours. However, research shows that the combination regimen, above is more effective than misoprostol alone.

 Expectant Management of IUFD involves awaiting spontaneous labour (may take up to 3 weeks).

 Recommendations about labour and birth should take into account the mother's preferences, her medical condition and previous intra-partum history.

 Vaginal birth is the recommended mode of delivery for most women, but caesarean birth may need to be considered in individual cases.

 Pregnancy tissue should be treated in the same way as other biological material unless the individual expresses a desire for it to be managed otherwise.

 If a woman has had a previous caesarean section, a discussion as to the safety and benefits of induction of labour needs to be undertaken by a consultant obstetrician.

 Clinical assessment and evaluation are recommended to assess maternal wellbeing and to determine the cause of death, the chance of recurrence, and of avoiding future pregnancy complications.

 Laboratory tests are recommended to rule out any maternal disease or risk factor that may have contributed to the IUFD

 Fetal karyotyping should be considered in all cases.

 Parents should be offered a full postmortem examination of the baby.

 Postmortem examination should include external examination with birth weight, histology of relevant tissues and plain radiography (skeletal survey)

 Pathological examination of the cord, membranes and placenta is recommended in all cases of IUFD

 Standardized checklists should be used to ensure that all appropriate care options are offered and that each response mark is recorded.

 A standardized dataset should be collected for all IUFDs.

 All IUFDs should be reviewed in a multi-professional meeting using a standardized approach.

 All term intra-partum deaths with no evidence of a major congenital anomaly should be investigated locally.

 Staff working with bereaved parents should be provided with an opportunity to develop their knowledge and understanding of perinatal loss, together with the development of skills in working in this area.

 A system should be in place to give clinical and psychological support to staff involved with an IUFD.

 A follow-up appointment with the consultant obstetrician should be arranged and it should be clear who is responsible for making these arrangements.

 Women with a history of IUFD should attend a consultant-led hospital-based antenatal clinic in their next pregnancy and undergo increased antenatal surveillance.

NOTE

Medical management of IUFD with mifepristone and misoprostol combined is contraindicated in any person with a known allergy to either medication, ectopic pregnancy, chronic adrenal failure, or inherited porphyria, and used with caution in women with life-threatening un-stabilized conditions such as uncontrolled cardiac disease, severe anemia, or hemorrhagic disorders, uncontrolled serious asthma or in those with an IUD in place.

Medical management of induced abortion

Medical management of induced abortion (for both viable and non-viable pregnancies) at early or later gestational ages involves the use of a single-drug regimen or a combination regimen of medicines used in sequence, with specific dosages and routes of administration.

In Uganda, the following categories of people who can get services for termination of pregnancy:

 severe maternal illnesses threatening the health of a pregnant woman e.g. severe cardiac disease, renal disease, severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia;

 severe foetal abnormalities which are not compatible with extra-uterine life e.g. molar pregnancy, anencephaly;  cancer cervix.

 HIV-positive women requesting for a termination.

 Rape, incest, and defilement.

NOTE:

Medical termination of pregnancy services can be provided at;

 HC IV

 general hospital, and

 referral hospital levels.

By a medical officer, or gynae/surgeon

### Management

Management

For medical management of induced abortion at gestation ages < 12 weeks:

 Two-medication regimen: First, the use of 200 mg mifepristone is administered orally, followed 1-2 days later by 800 µg of misoprostol administered vaginally, sublingually, or buccally. The minimum recommended interval between use of mifepristone and misoprostol is 24 hours. These medications can be taken by the person herself, or administered on an outpatient basis by trained health workers.

 Single-medication regimen: 800 µg misoprostol administered buccally, sublingually, or vaginally.

Evidence from clinical studies demonstrates that the combination regimen is more effective than misoprostol alone.

For either regimen:

 Repeat doses of misoprostol can be considered when needed to achieve success of the abortion process. In this guideline we do not provide a maximum number of doses of misoprostol.

 All routes are included as options for misoprostol administration, in consideration of patient and provider preference

Medical management of induced abortion at gestational ages ≥ 12 weeks

 Two-medication regimen: 200 mg mifepristone is administered orally, followed 1-2 days later by repeat doses of 400 µg misoprostol administered buccally, sublingually or vaginally every 3 hours.* The minimum recommended interval between use of mifepristone and misoprostol is 24 hours.

 Single-medication regimen: When using misoprostol alone: recommend the use of repeat doses of 400 µg misoprostol administered vaginally, sublingually or buccally every 3 hours.

Pain Management

Should be proactive for medical management of induced abortion at any gestational age. Pain medication should be offered routinely (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]). It should be provided for the individual to use if and when wanted. Acetominophen can be used for pain control when NSAIDS are unavailable. Other methods of pain control, such as certain anti-emetics and epidural anaesthesia can be considered as necessary, with the goal of proactive, patient-centered pain management.

Precaution

 Ectopic pregnancy should be excluded, and intra-uterine gestation confirmed before the medical abortion. The medical abortion regimen will not terminate the ectopic pregnancy

 Fertility can return within two weeks therefore all patients should be given post-abortion contraception where eligible

 Access to appropriate medical care must be assured in case an emergency develops; the patient should be given clear verbal and written instructions on whom she should contact and where to go in case of concerns or suspected complications

17.4  INTEGRATED COMMUNITY CASE MANAGEMENT

Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) of malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea is a recently adopted strategy for the treatment of common childhood illness at community level by trained Community Health Workers since 2010. It addresses a gap in delivery of curative services to children below 5 years allowing:

 prompt and accessible treatment of uncomplicated malaria, pneu- monia and diarrhoea

 identification of danger signs (convulsions, chest in-

 drawing, unable to feed, vomiting everything, lethargy/ uncon- sciousness) and pre-referral treatment

 monitoring of newborns during the first week of life,

 counselling and referral if any problem identified.

Community health workers work in close collaboration with the health unit, to which they report and refer cases and from which they receive supplies and supervision.

Supplies provided to trained community health workers ICCM commodities

~ Respiratory timers and Amoxicillin dispersible tablets for diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia

~ ORS sachets and Zinc tablets for treatment of diarrhoea

~ RDTs and ACTs for diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated malaria

~ Rectal artesunate for pre referral treatment of complicated malaria.

~ Examination gloves

~ Dispensing envelopes

~ Registers, referral notes and sick job aids

Other commodities for community health workers

~ Other preventive treatments: used in prevention and treatment of common conditions and neglected topical diseases like albendazole, azithromycin syrup and tablets, ivermectin, tetracycline eye ointment, praziquantel, COC.

17.5  CHILD GROWTH WEIGHT STANDARDS CHARTS

The WHO Child Growth Standards charts are used to identify normal growth for children under 5 years, as well as growth problems or trends that suggest that a child is at risk of a problem.

Weight-for-Age

r Used to show if a child is normal weight or underweight for their age. It should not be used to assess obesity and overweight.

Disadvantages

If a child's age is unknown, it is of limited use

It cannot distinguish between chronic malnutrition (stunting) and acute malnutrition

Also, if a child has oedema of both feet, fluid retention increases the child's weight, masking what may actually be very low weight.

Weight for-Height/Length

r Used to diagnose acute malnutrition

r The cut-off for severe acute malnutrition is -3 z-scores and be- low. These children are at a high risk of mortality, but respond quickly and safely to re-feeding using therapeutic foods following recommended guidelines.

r The cut-off for moderate acute malnutrition is -2 to -3 z-scores below.

18.1  ROUTINE CHILDHOOD VACCINATION

18.1.1   National Immunization Schedule

Adapted from the UNEPI/MOH Immunization Schedule, 2022

General principles of routine childhood immunization

~ The aim is to ensure that all target age groups complete their immunization schedule as above

~ Age  for  vaccinations:  Give  each  vaccine  at  the  recommended age or if this is not possible, at any first contact with the child after this age

~ BCG vaccination

-Give this as early as possible in life, preferably at birth

-Do NOT give BCG vaccine to any child with clinical signs and symptoms of immunosuppression, e.g. AIDS

~ Use each vaccine with its corresponding pre-cooled diluent from the same manufacturer

~ Polio vaccination (= 'birth dose'): This is a primer dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV), which should be given ideally at birth but otherwise in the first 2 weeks of life

~ DPT-HepB-Hib vaccine

Is a combination of DPT vaccine + hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) + haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine

Minimum interval between each of the doses is 4 weeks ~ Measles rubella vaccination

 Given at 9  and 18 months of age or first contact after this age

 Can also be given to any unimmunised child of 6-9 months

 old who has been exposed to measles patients. Children vaccinated in this way must have the vaccination repeated at 9 months of age

~ Vaccination of sick children

 Admit and treat any child who is severely ill, and vaccinate at the time of discharge

 Minor illness is not a contraindication to vaccination

 Screen clients at points of care and administer the due vaccines

 Screen clients for vaccine preventable diseases for investigation and notification

Administration and storage of vaccines

Storage and transport

~ At health units, vaccines should be stored between +2°C to

~ +8°C

~ At the district and central vaccine stores (static units) where freezers exist, polio and measles rubella vaccines may be stored for prolonged periods at -20°C

~ Do not freeze DPT-HepB-Hib, PCV, IPV, HPV, hepatitis B, yellow fever and TT vaccines

~ Never freeze the diluents for BCG,yellow fever  and measles vaccines

~ Use conditioned ice packs and sponge method for transport

Carefully follow recommended procedures to maintain the cold chain for all vaccines, e.g.:

 Ensure continuous supply of power/gas

 Record fridge temperature twice daily (morning and evening, including weekends/public holidays)

 Use sponge method during each immunization session

Reconstitution and administration

~ Never use the diluents provided for vaccines to mix other injectable medicines

~ Never use water for injection as a diluent for vaccine reconstitution

Do not vaccinate in direct sunlight (always carry out immunization in a building or under a shade)

~ Record every vaccination in the child register  and  on  a tally sheet until child has completed all the antigens

~ Use the child register and child health card for tracking drop outs

~ A child who received any immunization dose during national immunization campaigns should still get the routine vaccination doses

~ Never use any vaccine:

-After its expiry date

-When  the  vaccine  vial  monitor  (VVM)  has  changed  to discard point (stage 3 and 4)

-If there has been contamination, or contamination is

-suspected in open vials

-If the vial labels are lost

-DPT-HepB-Hib, HebB, PCV,rotavirus vaccine, IPV, HPV, TT/Td that have been frozen

Adhere to the WHO recommended Multi-Dose Vial Policy (MDVP) as below:

Nutrition is the intake of food, considered in relation to the body's dietary needs. Good nutrition - an adequate, well balanced diet combined with regular physical activity - is a cornerstone of good health.

Poor nutrition can lead to reduced immunity, increased susceptibility to disease, impaired physical and mental development, and reduced productivity.

Optimal nutrition means obtaining a balance of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).

Macronutrients provide energy for organ and tissue functions and growth, and micronutrients are needed in small amounts for chemical processes in the body such as metabolism, growth, and protection against infections.

In addition, plenty of water is needed to build cells and regulate body processes.

Nutrition

19.1  NUTRITION GUIDELINES IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS

19.1.1  Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF)

Counsel and support all mothers to initiate breastfeeding within an hour of delivery and exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six months of life, unless medically contraindicated.

Teach mother correct positioning and attachment for breastfeeding, how to express and store breast milk hygienically, and how to feed the child by a cup.

Counsel and support parents to introduce adequate, safe, and appropriate complementary foods at 6 months of age, and to continue breast feeding until the child is 2 years.

A good diet should be adequate in quantity and include an energy-rich food (e.g. thick cereal with added oil, meat, fish, eggs, legumes, fruits and vegetables)

Pregnant women and lactating mothers should consume adequate nutritious foods

Recommend exclusive breastfeeding for infants of HIV-infected women for the first 6 months unless the replacement is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe (AFASS).

Malnourished children should be provided with appropriate medical care, nutritional rehabilitation, and follow-up.

Encourage mothers of low birth weight infants who can suckle to breastfeed. Assist those who cannot breastfeed to express breast milk and feed the baby.

During illness, children should take increased fluids: breastfeed more often, increase amount of milk given, increase fluid intake (e.g. soups, yoghurt, and drinking water). Extra fluid in diarrhoea is especially life-saving

For more information on feeding recommendations in infants and young children, see IMCI section 17.3.12.3

#### Management

19.1.2  Nutrition in HIV/AIDS

Good nutrition in HIV/AIDS is important as it helps to:

~ Prevent malnutrition and wasting

~ Delay the progress of HIV to AIDS

~ Enhance the body's ability to fight opportunistic infections

~ Achieve and maintain optimal body weight and strength

Relieve complications, e.g., diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, thrush

~ Improve effectiveness and tolerance of medication

~ Improve quality of life

Severe malnutrition is diagnosed when:

~ BMI <16 kg/m2

~ Weight loss >10% in past 2 months

~ MUAC <185 mm (<210 mm if pregnant or postpartum)

~ Persistent diarrhoea or fever

Management

#### TREATMENT

TREATMENT

LOC

If patient has other complications

 Admit patient and treat infections and rehydrate

If patient has no other medical complications

 Treat as an outpatient

 Promote weight gain with high-energy foods, protein, vitamins and minerals

 If ready-to-use therapeutic food is available, give 3 sa- chets Supplement the patient's diet with multivitamins and minerals, 1-2 tablets per day e.g, a combination of selenium and molinga has been proven to be beneficial per day in adults, in addition to normal food

See next section 19.2 for malnutrition in children

 Follow up in 2 weeks, at 1 month, then every 2 months thereafter

HC4 HC3

### 19.1.3 Nutrition in Diabetes

19.1.3  Nutrition in Diabetes

People with diabetes should follow normal nutritional guidelines for the general population, and can eat the same foods as the whole family since everyone benefits from healthy eating.

Healthy eating and exercise in diabetics help to:

 Maintain the blood glucose close to normal to prevent complications

 Control cholesterol levels

 Control blood pressure, and reduce the risk of complications such as heart disease and stroke

In addition, diabetics have to take care to balance their food with insulin and oral antidiabetic medications to help manage their blood glucose levels.

Healthy diet involves eating a variety of foods including vegetables, whole grains, fruits, non-fat dairy products, beans, lean meat, poultry, and fish. These are rich in vitamins, minerals and fibre. Avoid processed foods.

General advice

~ Eat three meals a day. Avoid skipping meals, and space out breakfast, lunch, and evening meal over the day

~ At  each  meal,  include  moderate  amount  (around  1/3  of the plate) of starchy carbohydrate foods, e.g., bread, pasta, chapatis,  potatoes,  yams,  noodles,  rice,  and  cereals.  Eat more  slowly  absorbed  (low  glycaemic  index)  foods,  e.g., pasta, rice, sweet potato and yam, porridge oats, bran, and natural muesli

~ Reduce fat in the diet, especially saturated fats. Use unsaturated fats or oils e.g. olive oil, sunflower oil

~ Eat more fruit and vegetables. Aim for at least five portions a day. Eat more beans and lentils.

~ Limit sugar and sugary foods

~ Reduce salt in the diet to 6 g or less per day

~ Drink alcohol only in moderation: 1 drink (one beer or one small glass of wine or one shot of spirit) for women and

2 for men as a maximum amount daily. Alcohol has some cardioprotective effect. It should be consumed with food to prevent hypoglycaemia

~ Don't use products marketed as 'diabetic foods, drinks or herbs' (they are expensive and of no benefit)

~ Routine supplementation with vitamins and minerals without underlying actual deficiency is not beneficial, patients should eat lots of fruits and vegetables e.g, a combination of selenium and molinga has been proven to be beneficial

~ Obese and overweight patients need to be encouraged to reduce weight using exercise and diet modifications

19.2  MALNUTRITION ICD10 CODE: E40-43 19.2.1  Introduction on Malnutrition

Malnutrition is the cellular imbalance between the supply of nutrients and energy and the body's demand for them to ensure growth, maintenance, and specific functions. It includes both under- and over nutrition.

However, the term 'malnutrition' commonly refers to undernutrition, and is used as such in these guidelines.

Although malnutrition can affect all ages, however, the early stages, including, foetus, infants and children, are most vulnerable to the effects of undernutrition during the period of their most rapid physical growth and development during the first two years of life.

Malnutrition is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality among children under 5 years in Uganda. It also makes the prognosis of other diseases poor.

Note

 Previously, malnutrition was classified into two types: 1) ProteinEnergy Malnutrition (PEM) due to lack of adequate protein and energy  in  the  diet  and  2)  Micronutrient  malnutrition-due  to deficiencies in specific micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).

 These  causal  names  are  now  avoided  because  protein  and energy deficits are likely to be accompanied by deficiencies of other  nutrients,  and  management  of  malnutrition  takes  this into consideration.

Causes/contributing factors to malnutrition

~ Immediate causes: diet and disease

 Inadequate quantity and quality of food

 Lack of knowledge on appropriate foods provided to children, poor food preparation, food taboos

 Infections: reduce appetite, increase energy and nutrient utilisation, and limit the ability to absorb or retain nutrients e.g. in diarrhoea, intestinal parasites

~ Root causes: food insecurity, poor health services, poor environmental sanitation, natural disasters, excessive workload for women, poor weaning practices, culture, in- adequate  water  supply,  low  literacy  levels,  low  nutrition advocacy/education

~ Underlying causes: poverty, corruption, poor governance, poor infrastructure.

Consequences of malnutrition

~ Impaired growth, physical and mental and development

~ Impaired body resistance/immune system

~ Increased risk of adult chronic diseases

~ Increased risk of mortality

~ Increased risk for the cycle of inter-generational malnutri- tion

~ Poor economic well-being for the individual and country

#### Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis

~ Nephrotic syndrome (nephritis)

~ Liver disease

~ Heart disease

~ Malabsorption syndrome

~ Malignancy  (e.g.,  gastrointestinal  tract  cancer,  liver  can- cer/hepatocellular carcinoma)

#### 19.2.1.1 Classification of Malnutrition

19.2.1.1  Classi/uniFB01cation of Malnutrition

Clinical features of malnutrition

~ Marasmus:  severe  wasting,  old  man's  face,  excess  skin' hangs  around  the  buttocks,  ribs  and  zygoma  bones  are prominent,  scapular  blades  and  extremities  (limbs),  eyes are sunken

-Apathetic or irritable, appetite is fairly good, skin is almost normal, hair demonstrates some changes but not as dramatic as  in  Kwashiorkor,  organomegaly  is  rare  (liver  and  spleen enlargement)

~ Kwashiakor: pitting feet oedema, skin desquamation, hair changes, presence of bilateral pitting oedema (oedema of both feet), moon face



[TABLE]
TYPE
DEFINITION OR FEATURES
Acute
~ Is an indicator of current nutritional status, reflecting recent weight changes or disrup- tion in nutrient intake
~ Most appropriate indicator to use in an emergency setting (e.g. due to sudden/ sharp period of food shortage)
~ Associated with loss of body fat and severe wasting
~ Children are thinner than their comparable age group of same height
~ Classified as Moderate or Severe based on anthropometry (measurement of the size, weight and proportions of the human body), biochemistry and clinical assessment
Chronic
~ Is an indicator of the nutritional status over- time; chronically malnourished children are shorter (stunted) than their comparable age group
[/TABLE]



#### 19.2.1.2 Assessing Malnutrition in Children 6 months to 5 years

 Appears  adequately nourished due to excess extra cellular fluid, but is very miserable, apathetic

 Skin changes (dermatosis, flacky paint dermatitis)

 Hair changes: Silky, straight, sparsely distributed; easily, painlessly pluckable

 Severe pallor of the conjunctiva, mucous membranes, palms, and soles, loss of skin turgor (dehydration)

 Organomegaly (liver, spleen) is common

~ Marasmus-kwashiakor: most common form, presents with features of both Marasmus and Kwashiorkor

19.2.1.2  Assessing Malnutrition in Children 6 months to 5 years

The 4 key features used to diagnose acute malnutrition are:

 Weight-for-Height/Length (WFH/L) using WHO growth standards charts (see section 15.5). It is the best indicator for diagnosing acute malnutrition.

 Mean Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) in mm using a measuring tape (see section 17.5)

 Oedema of both feet (kwashiorkor with or without severe wasting)

 Appetite test: ability to finish portion of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF).

WEIGHT FOR AGE (WFA) reflects both long term (stunting) and short term (wasting) nutritional status, so it is not very useful for diagnosis of acute malnutrition.

It can also miss out oedematous children, who are very malnourished but may have a near-normal weight because of fluid retention.

##### Investigations

Investigations

Children with SAM should always be first assessed with a full clinical examination to confirm presence of any danger sign, medical com- plications, and tested for appetite.

 Assess patient's history of:

 Recent intake of food, loss of appetite, breastfeeding

 Usual diet before current illness (compare the answers to the Feeding Recommendations for the Child's age (section 17.3.12.3)

 Duration, frequency and type of diarrhoea and vomiting

 Family circumstances

 Cough >2 weeks and contact with TB

 Contact with measles

 Known or suspected HIV infection/exposure

 Initial examination for danger signs and medical complications:

 Shock: lethargy or unconscious, cold hands, slow capillary refill (<3 seconds), weak pulse, low blood pressure

 Signs of dehydration

 Severe palmar pallor

 Bilateral pitting oedema

 Eye signs of vitamin A deficiency: dry conjunctiva, corneal ulceration, keratomalacia, photophobia

 Local signs of infection: ear, throat, skin, pneumonia

 Signs of HIV (see WHO Clinical Staging section 3.1.1)

 Fever (³37.5°C) or hypothermia (rectal temp <35.5°C)

 Mouth ulcers

 Skin changes of kwashiorkor: hypo- or hyperpigmentation, desqua- mation, ulcerations all over the body, exudative lesions (resembling burns) with secondary infection (including candida)

 Laboratory tests

 Blood glucose

-Complete blood count or Hb, malaria, HIV, electrolytes

-Stool  microscopy  for  ova  and  cysts,  occult  blood,  and parasites

 Chest X-ray: Look for evidence of tuberculosis or other chest abnormalities

 Conduct an appetite test

-Assess all children ³6 months for appetite at the initial visit and at every follow up visit to the health facility

HOW TO DO APPETITE TEST

~ Arrange  a  quiet  corner  where  the  child  and  mother  can  take their time to eat RUTF. Usually the child eats the RUTF portion within 30 minutes

Explain to the mother

~ The purpose of assessing the child's appetite

~ What RUTF is

~ How to give RUTF

-Wash hands before giving RUTF

-Sit with child and gently offer RUTF

-Encourage child to eat without feeding by force

-Offer plenty of water to drink from a cup during RUTF feeding

Offer appropriate amount of RUTF to child to eat:

~ After 30 minutes, check if the child was able to finish or not able to finish the amount of RUTF given and decide:

-Child ABLE to finish at least one third of a packet of RUTF portion (92 g) or 3 teaspoons from a pot within 30 minutes

-Child NOT ABLE to eat one-third of a packet of RUTF portion (92 g) or 3 teaspoons from a pot within 30 minutes

 Determine WFH/L: Measure the child's height and weight and plot the score on the appropriate chart (boy or girl). Match the value to the z-score on the right y-axis to determine the child's z-score (see section 17.5)

 Measure MUAC: Using a MUAC tape, measure the circumference

### 19.2.2 Management of Acute Malnutrition in Children

19.2.2   Management of Acute Malnutrition in Children

General principles of management

~ Admit all children with any danger sign, medical complications, pitting oedema or those who fail appetite tests for inpatient care and treatment for complicated SAM.

 Keep them in a warm area separated from infectious children, or in a special nutrition area.

~ Children with good appetite and no medical complications can be managed as outpatients for uncomplicated SAM.

~ Adequate facilities and staff to ensure correct preparation of therapeutic foods, and to feed child regularly day and night, should be available.

~ Accurate weighing machines and MUAC tapes should be available

~ Proper records of feeds given and child's measurements should be kept so that progress can be monitored

~ Explain to patient/care-giver to handle the child gently

#### 19.2.2.3 Management of Complicated Severe Acute Malnutrition

 Counsel the mother and encourage her to continue with appropriate RUTF feeding. Ask mother to return again in 14 days

If the child has moderate acute malnutrition:

 Advise the mother to continue RUTF. Counsel her to start other foods according to the age appropriate feeding recommendations (see section 17.3.12.3)

 Tell her to return in 14 days. Continue to see the child every 14 days until the child has no more acute malnutrition

If the child has no acute malnutrition (WFH/L is -2 z-scores or more, or MUAC is 125 mm or more)

 Praise the mother, STOP RUTF and counsel her about age appropriate feeding recommendations

19.2.2.3  Management of Complicated Severe Acute Malnutrition

In-patient care

~ Refer child to hospital: prevent hypoglycaemia by giving small sips of sugar water, keep the child warm, first dose of antibiotics (ampicillin + gentamicin)

~ Triage  the  children  to  fast-track  seriously  ill  patients  for assessment  and  care:  treat  shock,  hypoglycaemia,  and corneal ulceration, immediately

~ General treatment involves 10 steps in two phases: initial stabilisation for 1 week and rehabilitation (for weeks 2-6) as in the table below

Management of Complications in SAM

Hypoglycaemia (Blood sugar <3 mmol/L or <54 mg/dL)

~ All  severly  malnourished  children  are  at  a  risk  of  hypo- glycaemia, and should be given a feed or 10% glucose or sucrose, immediately on admission

~ Frequent 2 hour feeding is important

##### TREATMENT

TREATMENT

Immediately on admission

 Give 50 ml of glucose or sugar water (one rounded teaspoon of sugar in 3 tablespoons of water) orally or by NGT, followed by first feed as soon as possible

If child is able to drink

~ Give first feed of F-75 therapeutic milk, if available, ev- ery 30 minutes for 2 hours, then continue with feeds every 2 hours for 24 hours

Then give feeds every 2 or 3 hours, day and night

If child is unconscious

 Treat with IV 10% glucose at 5 ml/kg

 If IV access cannot be quickly established, give 10% glucose or sucrose solution by NGT tube. To make 10% solution, dilute 1 part of 50% glucose with 4 parts of water OR 1 part of glucose 50% with 9 parts of glucose 5%

##### Prevention

TREATMENT

If  IV  glucose  not  available,  give  1  teaspoon  of  sugar moistened  with  1-2  drops  of  water  sublingually,  and repeat every 20 minutes to prevent relapse

Monitor children for early swallowing which delays

absorption; if it happens, give another dose of sugar

Start on appropriate IV/IM antibiotics

Monitoring

If  initial  blood  glucose  was  low,  repeat  measurement  after 30  minutes

 If blood glucose falls to <3 mmol/L (<54 mg/dL), repeat the 10% glucose or oral sugar solution, and ensure antibiotics have been given

If it is higher, change to 3 hourly feeds of F-75

 If rectal tempearture falls to <35.5°C, or if level of consciousness deteriorates, repeat the blood glucose measurement and treat accordingly

Prevention

 Feed every 2 hours, starting immediately (see below), or if child is dehydrated, rehydrate first. Continue feeding throught the night

 Encourage mothers to watch for any deterioration, help feed and keep the child warm

 Check on abdominal distension

Hypothermia (Axillary temperature <35°C and rectal tempera - ture <35.5°C)

~ Often  associated  with  hypoglycaemia  or  serious  infection

TREATMENT

 Feed child immediately as in hypoglycaemia above

 Warm the child: make sure the child is well covered, especially the head, with cloths, hats, and blankets

If  available, use a heater but not pointing directly at the child. DO NOT use hot water bottles or flourescent lamps

 Encourage caretaker/mother to sleep next to her child and kangaroo technique for infants (skin-to-skin contact, direct heat/ warmth transfer from mother to child)

TREATMENT

 Keep the ward closed during the night and avoid wind drafts inside

 Give appropriate IV or IM antibiotics

 Change wet nappies, clothes and bedding to keep child and bed dry

 Quickly clean the patient with a warm wet towel and dry imme- diately. Avoid washing the baby directly in the first few weeks of admission

Monitoring

 Take child's rectal temperature every 2 hours until it rises to <36.5°C, If using a heater, take it every 30 minutes

 Cover the child at all times, especially at night. Keep head cov- ered with hat to prevent heat loss

 Check for hypoglycaemia

Dehydration

~ In  both  oedema and non-oedematous SAM, the margin of safety between dehydration and over-hydration is very narrow. Exercise care and caution to avoid over-hydration and risk of cardiac failure

 Assume that all children with watery diarrhoea or reduced urine output have some dehydration

TREATMENT

 Do NOT use IV route for rehydration, except in cases of shock

 Rehydrate slowly, either orally or by NGT using ReSoMal, a specially prepared rehydration solution for malnutrition, The standard ORS has a high sodium and low potassium content, which is not suitable for SAM, except if profuse diarrhoea is present

~ Give ReSoMal more slowly than you would when rehydrating a well-nourished child

Give 5 ml/kg every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours

Then give 5-10 ml/kg per hour for the next 4-10 hours, with F-75 formula. Exact amount depends on how much the child wants, the volume of stool loss and whether the child is vomiting

If ReSoMal not available:

Give half strength standard ORS, with added potassium and glucose as per the ReSoMal recipe below, unless the child has cholera or profuse

TREATMENT

watery diarrhoea

If rehydration still required at 10 hours, give starter F-75

Instead  of  ReSoMal,  at  the  same  times.  Give  the  same  volume  of starter F-75 as of ReSoMal

If child is unconscious, in shock or severe dehydration

 Give IV fluid Darrow's solution or Ringer's lactate and 5% glucose (or if not avail- able, ½ saline and 5% glucose at 15 mL/kg the first hour and reassess

If improving, give 15 mL/kg in second hour

If conscious, give NGT ReSoMal

If not improving, treat for septic shock

Monitoring

~ ONLY rehydrate  until  the  weight  deficit  is  corrected  and  then STOP, DO NOT give extra fluid to 'prevent recurrence' (from specialist's notes)

~ During  rehydration,  respiration  and  pulse  rate  should  fall  and urine passing should start

~ Return of tears, moist mouth, improved skin tugor and less sunk- en eyes and fontanelle are a sign of rehydration. SAM children will not show these and so weight gain should be measured

~ Monitor progress of rehydration every 30 minutes for 2 hours, then every hour for the next 4-10 hours

Be alert for signs of overhydration, which is dangerous and can lead to heart failure. Check for:

Weight gain (make sure it is not quick or excessive)

If increase in pulse rate by 25/minute, respiratory rate by 5/minute is present, stop ReSoMal. Reassess after 1 hour

Urine frequency (if child urinated since last check)

Enlarging liver size on palpation

Frequency of stools and vomit

Prevention

 Same as in dehydration in well-nourished child, except that ReSoMal is used instead of standard ORS. Give 30-50 ml of ReSoMal (for  child  <2  years)  and  100 ml (for child ³2 years) after each watery stool.

Small,  frequent,  unformed  stools  are  common  in  SAM  and  should not be confused with profuse watery stools, and they do not require treatment

 Continue breastfeeding

 Initiate re-feeding with starter F-75

 Give ReSoMal between feeds to replace stool lossess.

Give 50-100 ml after each watery stool

Electrolyte imbalance

~ All SAM children have deficiencies of potassium and mag- nesium, which may take up to 2 weeks to correct

~ Oedema is partly due to potassium deficiency and sodium retention

 Do not treat oedema with diuretics

 Giving high sodium doses could kill the child

TREATMENT

 Give extra potassium (3-4 mmol/kg per day) f Give extra mag- nesium (0.4-0.6 mmol/kg per day) f Add extra potassium and magnesium to the feeds. If not already pre-mixed, add 20 ml of the combined electrolyte/mineral solution to 1 litre of feed, or use pre- mixed sachets for SAM

 Use ReSoMal to rehydrate

 Prepare food without added salt

Infections

~ In  SAM, usual signs of bacterial infection, e.g. fever, are usually absent, yet multiple infections are common.

~ Assume all SAM cases have an infection, and treat with

antibiotics  immediately.  Hypoglycaemia  and  hypothermia are often signs of severe infection

TREATMENT

Broad spectrum antibiotics

 Benzylpenicillin 50,000 IU/kg IM or IV every 6 hours Or ampi- cillin 50 mg/kg every 6 hours for 2 days f Then, oral amoxicillin 25-40 mg/kg every 8 hours for

 5 days PLUS

 Gentamicin 7.5 mg/kg once a day for 7 days

 Measles vaccination

 If child is ³ 6 months and not vaccinated, or was vaccinated before 9 months of age. Delay vaccination if child is in shock

Other specific infections

 Treat other specific infections if diagnosed as appropriate, e.g., malaria, pneumonia, dysentery, soft- tissue infections, mengin- gitis, TB, HIV

 If parasitic worms are diagnosed, delay treatment until the re- habilitation phase. Give albendazole 200-400 mg single dose

In endemic areas, give mebendazole orally twice a day

for 3 days to all SAM children 7 days after admission

If  HIV  diagnosed,  start  ART  as  soon  as  possible  after stabilisation of metabolic compilcations

Monitoring

 If child is still anorexic after 7 days of antibiotic treatment, continue for a full 10-day course. If anorexia persists, reassess child fully

Micronutrient deficiencies

~ All SAM children have vitamin and mineral deficiencies

~ Anaemia is common, but DO NOT give iron initially, in- stead wait until the child has a good appetite and has start- ed gaining weight, usually in the second week, because iron can make infections worse

~ RUTF already contains adequate iron so do not add. F-100 does not contain iron, so iron supplements are needed

##### Management

~ F-75, F-100 and RUTF already contain multivitamins (including vitamin A and folic acid) zinc and copper. Additional doses are not needed

~ If there are no eye signs or history of measles, then do not give a high dose of vitamin A as therapeutic foods already contain adequate amounts

Management

TREATMENT

ONLY IF child has signs of vitamin A deficiency like corneal ulceration or history of measles

 Give Vitamin A on day 1, and repeat on days 2 and 14

Child <6 months: 50,000 IU

Child 6-12 months: 100,000 IU

Child >12 months: 200,000 IU

Note: If a first dose was given in the referring centre, treat on days 1 and 14 only

Iron

 Give iron in the second week of nutritional rehabilitation

Do not give in the stabilization phase

Do not give in children receiving RUTF

 Start iron at 3 mg/kg per day after 2 days on F-100 catch- up formula

If child is not on any pre-mixed therapeutic foods, give the following micronutrients daily for at least 2 weeks

 Folic   acid   at  5  mg  on  day   1;   then  1   mg  daily Multivitamin syrup 5 ml

 Zinc 2 mg/kg per day

 Copper at 0.3 mg/kg per day

 Other vitamins and minerals e.g, a combination of selenium and moringa has been proven to be beneficial

Initial Re-Feeding during Stabilisation Phase

In the initial phase, feeding should be gradual.

The essential features of initial feeding are:

~ Frequent (every 2-3 hours) oral small feeds of low osmolality and low lactose. Never leave the child alone or forcefeed the child, as this can cause aspiration pneumonia

~ Nasogastric tube feeding if the child is eating £ 80% of the amount offered at two consecutive feeds

~ Calories at 100 kcal/kg per day (do not exceed)

~ Protein at 1-1.5 g/kg per day

~ Liquid at 130 ml/kg per day or 100 ml/kg per day if child has severe oedema

~ Milk-based formulas, such as F-75 (with 75 kcal and 0.9 g protein/100 ml), will be satisfactory for most children

-Starter F-75 formula can be commercially supplied or

-locally prepared from basic ingredients

-In  children  who  get  osmotic  diarrhoea  with  commercial preparation,  prepare  a  cereal  based  F75  as  in  the  table overleaf

TREATMENT

 If child is breastfeeding, continue breastfeeding but add the prescribed amounts of the starter formula as in the table below:

 Feed from a cup or bowl. Use a spoon, dropper or syringe to feed very weak children

 Teach the mother or caregiver to help with the feeding

 Night feeds are essential, since long periods without a feed may lead to hypoglycaemia and death

-Amounts of feed offered and left over

-Vomiting

-Stool frequency and consistency

-Daily body weight

Recipe for refeeding formula F-75 and F-100

If pre-mixed formulas are not available, prepare as below

Note

 Cook cereal-based formula for 4 minutes and add mineral/ vitamin mix after cooking

Transition phase

This phase is designed to prepare the child for phase 2 or outpatient management (catch up growth).

Signs that a child is ready for transition:

~ Return of appetite

~ No episodes of hypoglycaemia (metabolically stable)

~ Reduction in or disappearance of all oedema

Make a transition from starter formula to catch-up formula, gradually over 2-3 days. DO NOT switch at once.

Management

TREATMENT

 Make a gradual transition from starter F-75 to catch-up formula F-100 or RUTF over 2-3 days, as tolerated

 Give RUTF or a milk-based formula, e.g, F-100 containing 100 kcal/100 mL and 2.9 g of protein per 100 ml. Replace starter F-75 with an equal amount of catch- up F-100 for 2 days.

 If RUTF is available

 Start with small but regular meals of RUTF and encourage child to eat often (first, 8 meals per day, and later, 5-6 meals per day)

 If child cannot eat whole amount of RUTF per meal in the transition phase, top-up with F-75 to complete the feed, until child is able to eat a whole RUTF meal

 If child cannot take at least half of the RUTF in 12 hours, stop RUTF and give F-75. Try introducing RUTF again in 1-2 days until the child is able to take adequate amount

 If still breastfeeding, offer breast milk first before each RUTF feed

If RUTF is not available or child does not accept it, give F-100

~ In the first 2 days, give F-100 every 3-4 hours (the same amount  of  F-75  that  they  were  being  given).  Do  not increase volume for 2 days

~ On the 3rd day, increase each successive feed by 10 ml until child finishes the meal

~ If  the  child  does  not  finish  the  meal,  offer  the  same amount for the next meal

~ Keep adding 10 ml until the child leaves a bit of most of his meals (i.e. point at which intake is likely to have reached 200 ml/kg per day)

TREATMENT

 If child is being breasfed, encourage mother to breastfeed in between F-100 rations

 After a gradual transition, give:

-Frequent feeds, unlimited amounts

-150-220 kcal/kg per day

-4-6 g of protein/kg per day

Caution

 F-100  should  never  be  given  to  take  home.  Transition  to RUTF

Monitoring

 Monitor the child at least every 4 hours during transition

 Return child to stabilization phase if:

-Child develops loss of appetite, cannot take 80% of the feeds, develops or increased oedema, medical conditions not improving, any signs of fluid overload, significant refeeding diarrhoea

Avoid causing heart failure

Early signs of congestive heart failure (e.g. rapid pulse, fast breathing, basal lung crepitations, enlarging liver, gallop heart rhythm, raised jugular venous pressure

If pulse is increased by 25 beats/minute and breathing rate by 5 breaths/minute, and the increase is sustained for two successive 4-hourly readings, then:

-Reduce volume fed to 100 ml/kg per day for 24 hours

~ Then gradually increase as follows:

-115 ml/kg per day for next 24 hours

-130 ml/kg per day for the following 48 hours

~ Then,  increase  each  feed  by  10  ml  as  described  earlier

Recommended amounts for RUTF

Patient instructions on how to give RUTF

~ Wash hands before giving the RUTF

~ Sit with child on the lap and gently offer RUTF

~ Encourage child to eat RUTF without force-feeding

~ Give small, regular meals of RUTF and encourage child to eat 5-6 meals a day

~ If still breastfeeding, continue offering breast milk first before every RUTF feed

~ Give only the RUTF for 2 weeks, if breastfeeding continue to breastfeed and gradually introduce foods recommended for the age (see section 17.3.12.3)

~ When  introducing  recommended  foods,  ensure  that  the child completes his daily ration of RUTF before giving other foods

~ Offer plenty of clean water, to drink from a cup, when the child is eating the RUTF

Catch-up growth or rehabilitation phase

Criteria for transfer from transition phase

~ Good appetite (child takes >80% of daily ration of RUTF)

~ Significantly reduced oedema or no oedema

~ Resolved medical complications and completed parenteral antibiotics

~ Clinically well and alert

After the transition phase

Children with complicated SAM can be transferred to outpatient care during rehabilitation phase. The child will require continuing care as an outpatient to complete rehabilitation and prevent relapse.

~ Carefully assess the child and the available commuinty support

~ Refer the child for rehabilitation in outpatient care or to a community feeding programme if possible, otherwise keep the child admitted

TREATMENT

If the child cannot be managed as outpatient (e.g. no easily accessible nutritional rehabilitation services where the child lives)

 Keep the child admitted until full discharge from nutritional program

 Continue with RUTF or F-100, but increase amount as the child gains weight

If the child can be managed as outpatient

 Discharge the mother with 2-week supply of RUTF according to the table above

TREATMENT

 Counsel caregivers on outpatient treatment and link them to a community nutritional programme if available. Ensure that mother/caregiver:

-Brings back the child for weekly supplements

-Is available for child care

Has received specific counselling on appropriate child feeding practices (types, amount, frequency) and basic hygiene

-Has resources to feed child (if not, give advice on available support)

Monitoring (by rate of weight gain)

~ Weigh  child  every  morning  before  feeding,  and  plot  the weight

~ Calculate and record weight gain every 3 days as g/kg per day

For example

Current weight of child = 6300 g Weight 3 days ago = 6000 g Weight gain in grams: 6300-6000 = 300 g Average daily weight gain = 300 g ÷ 3 days = 100 g/day

Child's average weight: (6000 + 6300) ÷ 2 = 6150 g

(6.15 kg)

Divide by child's average weight in kg: 100 g/day ÷ 6.15 kg = 16.3 g/kg per day

If the weight gain is:

-Poor (<5 g/kg per day), child needs a full reassessment

-Moderate  (5-10  g/kg  per  day),  check  if  intake  targets  are being met or if infection has been overlooked

-Good (>10 g/kg/day): continue rehabilitation

Sensory stimulation

Provide:

~ Tendor loving care

~ A cheerful, stimulating environment

#### 19.2.2.4 Treatment of Associated Conditions

~ Structured play therapy for 15-30 minutes/day

~ Physical activity as soon as the child is well enough

~ As much maternal involvement as possible (e.g., comforting, feeding, bathing, playing)

~ Provide suitable toys and play activities for the child

19.2.2.4  Treatment of Associated Conditions

Eye problems

TREATMENT

 Apply barrier cream (zinc and castor oil ointment or petroleum jelly) to the raw areas, and gentian violet or nystatin cream to skin sores

 Avoid using nappies so that the perinuem can stay dry

Severe anaemia

TREATMENT

Severe anaemia

 Give blood transfusion in the first 24 hours ONLY IF:

-Hb is <4 g/dL

-Hb is 4-6 g/dl, and the child has respiratory distress

 Use smaller volumes and slower transfusion than for a well-nourished child. Give:

-Whole blood, 10 ml/kg over 3 hours

-Furosemide, 1 mg/kg at the start of the transfusion

If child has signs of heart failure

 Give 10 mL/kg of packed cells, as whole blood may worsen heart failure

Note

 Children  with  SAM  and  oedema  may  have  redistribution of fluid leading to apparent low Hb, which does not require transfusion

Monitoring

~ Monitor pulse and breathing rates, listen to lung fields, examine adbomen for liver  size,  check  jugular  venous pressure every 15 minutes during transfusion

-If either breathing rate increases by 5 breaths/minute or heart rate increases by 25 beats/minute, transfuse more slowly

-If there are basal lung crepitations or an enlarging liver, stop transfusion and give IV furosemide IV at 1 mg/kg

##### TREATMENT

TREATMENT

If child has signs of vitamin A deficiency like corneal ulcera- tion

 Give vitamin A on day 1, repeat on days 2 and 14

Child <6 months: 50,000 IU

Child 6-12 months: 100,000 IU

Child >12 months: 200,000 IU

If a first dose was given in the referring centre, treat on days 1 and 14 only

If eyes show corneal clouding or ulceration, give care below to prevent corneal rupture and lens extrusion

 Instil chloramphenicol or tetracycline eye drops 4 times a day, for 3-5 days

 Instil atropine eye drops, 1 drop 3 times a day for 3-5 days

 Cover with saline soaked pads

 Bandage the eyes

Skin lesions in kwashiorkor

Usually due to zinc deficiency. The child's skin quickly improves with zinc supplementation. In addition:

TREATMENT

 Bathe or soak affected areas for 10 minutes per day in

 0.01% potassium permanganate solution

#### 19.2.2.5 Discharge from Nutritional Programme

19.2.2.5   Discharge from Nutritional Programme

Discharge children with SAM from nutritional treatment ONLY IF:

~ Weight-for-height or length is at least ³-2 z score and they have no oedema for at least 2 weeks, or

~ Mid-upper-arm circumference is ³125 mm and they have no oedema for at least 2 weeks

~ The indicator used at admission should be the same one used during follow-up. If only pitting oedema was used at diagnosis, then either WFH/L or MUAC can be used for follow-up

 Percentage weight gain should not be used as a criterion

Feeding after discharge from nutritional programme Counsel the mother

on feeding and other issues as in the table below

Feeding instructions

~ Feed child at least 5 times a day with meals that contain high energy and high protein content (100 kcal and 2-3 g protein per 100 g of food)

~ Give  high  energy  snacks  between  meals  (e.g.,  milk,  banana, bread, biscuits)

~ Assist and encourage child to complete each meal

~ Give food separately to child so their intake can be checked

~ Breastfeed as often as the child wants

Additional instructions

~ How to continue any needed medications at home

~ Danger signs to bring child back for immediate care

~ When and where to go for planned follow-up: at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months; then twice a year until when the child is 3 years old

~ Where and when to take child for growth monitoring and pro- motion on monthly basis up to 2 years

~ When to return for next immunisation, vitamin A, and deworing

~ How to continue stimulating the child at home with play acti ities

##### TREATMENT

Persistent diarrhoea

TREATMENT

If Giardiasis suspected or confirmed by stool microscopy

 Give metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg every 8 hours for 7 days

If due to lactose intolerance (very rare)

Diagnosed if profuse watery diarrhoea only occurs after milk-based feeds are begun and stops when they are withdrawn or reduced

 Replace feeds with yoghurt or a lactose free infant formula

 Reintroduce milk feeds gradually in the rehabilitation phase

Osmotic diarrhoea

Suspect if diarrhoea worsens substantially with hyperosmolar F-75 and ceases when sugar and osmolality are reduced

 Use a cereal-based starter F-75, or if necessary, a commercially available isotonic starter

 Introduce catch-up F-100 or RUTF gradually

##### Follow-up

Follow-up

PlanWhen child is discharged, make a follow-up plan until full recovery, with the appropriate clinic (e.g., OPD, nutrition clinic or local health worker/clinic).

~ Weigh the child weekly after discharge

~ If child fails to gain weight over 2 weeks, loses weight between 2 measurements, develops loss of appetite or oedema, refer child back to hospital for a full reassessment

Monitor child periodically after discharge from the nutritional programme to prevent relapse: at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months; then twice a year until when the child is 3 years old

### 19.2.3 SAM in Infants Less than 6 Months

19.2.3  SAM in Infants Less than 6 Months

SAM in infants <6 months is rare. An organic cause or failure to thrive should be considered and treated. Admit the infant with SAM if any of the following are present:

~ General danger signs or serious condition

~ Recent weight loss or failure to gain weight

~ Ineffective breastfeeding (attachment, positioning, or suckling) directly observed for 15-20 minutes

Any pitting bilateral  oedema  of  feet

~ Any medical problem needing more assessment

~ Any social issue needing detailed assesssment or intensive support e.g depression of caretaker

#### Management

Management

#### TREATMENT

TREATMENT

Initial Phase

 Admit child

 Give parenteral antibiotics to treat possible sepsis and appropriate treatment for other medical complications

 Re-establish effective breastfeeding by mother or give infant formula, safely prepared and used

 In infants with SAM and oedema, give infant formula (preferably) or if not available, F-75 or diluted F-100 (use 1.5 litres instead of 1 litre)

 For infants with SAM and NO oedema, give expressed breast milk; if not possible, give commercial infant formula, F-75 or diluted F-100 in this order of preference

 Assess the physical and mental health of mothers or caretakers. Provide relevant treatment and support

### 19.2.4 Obesity and Overweight

19.2.4   Obesity and Overweight ICD10 CODE: E66

Overweight and obesity are an abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. It is a risk factor for many diseases and is linked to many deaths. Body mass index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height used to classify overweight and obesity in adults.

BMI =

Weight (in kilograms)

Height (in metres) squared (m2)

Interpretation of BMI values in adults

In children, age needs to be considered when defining overweight and obesity

#### TREATMENT

TREATMENT

Discharge

~

Infants can be transferred to outpatient care if:

-All clinical conditions, medical complications and oedema are resolved, or if child is clinically well and alert

-Child is breastfeeding effectively or feeding well

-Weight  gain  is  satisfactory,  e.g.,  above  median  WHO growth  velocity  standards  or  >5  g/kg  per  day  for  3 successive days

~ Before discharge, verify immunisation status, link mothers  and  caregivers  with  community  follow-on  support and ensure that child is breastfeeding well, has an adequate weight gain and has WFL ³-2 Z scores

### 20.2.2 Glaucoma

20.2.2     Glaucoma

ICD10 CODE: H40

Glaucoma is a group of disorders characterised by a loss of visual field associated with cupping of the optic disc and optic nerve damage. Although glaucoma is associated with raised intra-ocular pressure (IOP), it can also occur when this pressure is within the normal range.

Glaucoma is classified as either open-angle or angle-closure glaucoma. Primary open-angle glaucoma is the most common.

Risk factors for open-angle glaucoma

~ Older age, black people, family history, genetics

~ Vascular dys-regulation (migraine, vasospasm, abnormalities in ocular blood flow), low ocular perfusion pressure, diabetes

~ Ocular factors: Raised intra-ocular pressure, myopia, central  corneal  thickness  -  thinner  corneas  associated  with increased risk

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

Open angle glaucoma

~ Mostly asymptomatic

~ History of gradual loss of vision in affected eye or loss of visual field

~ Often suspected after seeing cupping of optic disc on routine fundoscopy or finding elevated intra-ocular pressure on screening

Angle-closure glaucoma

~ Sudden onset of severe eye pain and redness, associated with nausea, vomiting and headache

~ Loss of vision in the affected eye

~ Coloured halos or bright rings around lights

~ Hazy-looking cornea

### 20.2.3 Diabetic Retinopathy

20.2.3 Diabetic Retinopathy

ICD10 CODE: E10.31, E11.31

A disease in which small blood vessels are damaged due elevated blood sugar over a prolonged period of time.

#### Management

~ Fixed, semi-dilated pupil

~ Shallow anterior chamber

~ Severely elevated IOP. When palpated with a finger, the affected eye feels hard, compared to the other eye

~ If IOP rises more slowly, the patient may be asymptomatic with gradual loss of vision

Management

~ Goal of treatment is to arrest/delay progress of the disease, not for visual improvement. Therapy is usually life long

~ Angle-closure glaucoma is a medical emergency that requires urgent reduction of intra ocular pressure

Refer all suspects to specialist



[TABLE]
TREATMENT
LOC
Open-angle glaucoma

Timolol 0.5% eye drops given 1 drop 12 hourly


Clinical features



[TABLE]
Refractive Error
Causes
Clinical Features
Hyperopia, long-sightedness or far-sightedness, also termed hy- permetropia can be physiological (axial or refractive) or pathological (mal-development, anatomical or drug-induced) in
nature. Myopia, short-sightedness or near-sightedness It can be simple (length and power), pathological/de- generative (mal-de- velopment or anatomical) in nature, induced or pseudomyopia. Presbyopia It is an age-related visual impairment. It results from the gradual decrease in accommodation expected with age and can have multiple effects on quality of vision and quality of life.
 Axial etiology (length of the eye, small eyes)  Refractive etiology (power of the eye)  Trauma  Paralysis of ac- commodation

[TABLE]
CLASSIFICATION
FEATURES
Central vision
This is the detailed vision we use when we look directly at something. Age-related Macular degeneration (AMD) affects central vision. Diabetic retinopathy can affect central or peripheral vision
Peripheral vision
This is the less detailed vision we use to see everything around the edges. Glaucoma affects peripheral vision first. Strokes can affect one side of the peripheral vision
Contrast sensi- tivity
This is the ability to distinguish between objects of similar tones like milk in a white cup or to distinguish facial features. All eye problems can decrease contrast sensitivity
Depth perception
This is the ability to judge the position of objects. New vision loss in one eye can affect depth perception, such as the height of a step
Visual processing
The lens in our eye focuses light rays onto our retina. The retina converts these light rays into signals that are sent through the optic nerve to our brain, where they are inter- preted as the images we see. A problem with any of these processes affects our vision in various ways

~ Upper airway obstruction as shown by: flaring of the nostrils, recession of the chest inlet and/or below the ribs, rapid chest movements and reduced air entry (usually on the right side)

#### Investigations

Investigations

 Once the history and examination are suggestive, investigations can be omitted to save time

LOC

#### Management

 Chest x-ray may show lung collapse, hyperinflation, mediastinal shift, shift of heart shadow

Management

TREATMENT

LOC

Child

 If chocking, attempt to dislodge it by 3 cycles of 5 back slaps/5 chest compressions (for infants) or Heimlich manoeuvre (for children)



Do not do blind finger sweeps. If a foreign body is visible in the mouth, remove it with a Magill forceps

 If severe respiratory distress, refer to higher  level for airway visualization. Give oxygen if necessary

HC2

Adult

 Dislodge large FB, e.g. chunk of meat, from the phar- ynx by cycles of 5 back slaps and Heimlich manoeuvre (standing behind the patient with both arms around the upper abdomen and giving 5 thrusts)

If  patient  pregnant or very obese: Perform 6-10 chest thrusts with patient lying on the back

 If still suspect of FB, refer for airway visualization

#### Prevention

Prevention

~ Do not give groundnuts or other small hard food items to chil- dren <2 years

~ If a child is found with objects in the mouth, leave the child alone to chew and swallow or gently persuade the child to spit out the object

 Do not struggle with/force the child

### 21.3.2 Foreign Body in the Food Passage

21.3.2 Foreign Body in the Food Passage ICD10 CODE: T18

#### Causes

Causes

~ Types of FBs commonly involved include:

 Fish or chicken bones, often lodging in the tonsils, behind the tongue, or in the pharynx, occasionally in the oesophagus

~ Coins, especally in children. Coins are particularly likely to be ingested. Disc battery is particularly dangerous and requires immediate referral

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

~ Difficulty and pain in swallowing

 Patient winces as he attempts to swallow

~ Drooling of saliva

~ Patient may point to where foreign body is stuck with a finger (pointing sign)

~ FB may be seen, e.g., in tonsil, pharynx

#### Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis

~ Infection in pharynx

~ Trauma by foreign body

~ Medication ulcer (e.g. doxycycline)

#### Investigations

Investigations

 X-ray may reveal radio-opaque FB

 Coins may appear on X-rays done for other reasons

 Many FBs are radiolucent

 Look for a gas shadow if in the oesophagus

#### Management

Management

~ The approach depends upon the type of object ingested, the location of the object, and the patient's clinical status.

~ If negative radiographs, no symptoms and the FB does not be- long to a dangerous category (magnets, disc batteries, sharp long objects, superabsorbent polymer), expectant management is ad- vised.

~ If patient is symptomatic and/or the object is dangerous, imme- diate referral for further management.

#### TREATMENT

TREATMENT

LOC



Allow only clear fluids

 Do NOT try to dislodge/move the FB with solid food

This may push it into the wall of the oesophagus causing infection and sometimes death



Give IV infusion if unable to swallow liquids or if oral

fluid intake is poor

HC2

If FB is invisible on X-ray or symptoms persist >24 hours from time of ingestion

 Refer to hospital with ENT facility

If FB is visible in the pharynx, tonsil, etc.

 Grasp and remove it with long forceps

If patient tried to push FB with solid food:

 Give broad-spectrum antibiotic cover with amoxicillin 500 mg every 8 hours for 5 days

#### Prevention

Prevention

~ Keep potential FBs out of children's reach

~ Advise on care in eating, i.e., not taking in too large pieces of food, chewing thoroughly before swallowing

~ Advise once a FB is stuck to avoid trying to 'push' it down with solid food as this may sometimes be fatal

### Clinical features

Clinical features

~ Varies from white opacities to severe pitting and discolouration due to incorporation of the excess fluoride in the enamel structure

Prevention

~ Monitoring of fluoride levels in drinking water

~ Use of fluoride-free toothpastes in endemic areas

23.1.5. False Teeth ('Ebinnyo')

Traditional beliefs in many Ugandan communities attribute diarrhoea, fever, and vomiting in children to the developing dentition with the belief that if the offending teeth or 'ebinnyo' are not removed, the child will die.

Facts on ebinyo

~ The  practice  of  extraction  of  ebinnyo/false  teeth  is  based  on the  belief  that  rubbing  of  herbs  on  the  gum  (in  the  region  of the canine), or the removal of the primary and/ or permanent canine tooth buds will lead to the relief of childhood fevers and diarrhoea,

The procedure is done as early as 1 month and up to 3 years of age. Most studies report a peak age of 4-18 months

~ Whereas infant illnesses may be attributed to the teething period, they are in fact a result of the poor health conditions in which these children are raised

~ The term ebinyo encompasses both the child's ailment, as well as the treatment offered by traditional healers

Consequences of traditional treatment of ebinyo

Malocclusion is any deviation from the normal relation of the teeth in the same arch to each other, and to the teeth in the opposite arch

Causes

~ Aetiology is usually multifactorial

~ Discrepancies in the craniofacial skeleton, dentition, or both

#### Management

Cases that require treatment

~ The main indications for orthodontic treatment are aesthetics and function.

~ Crossbites (as associated occlusal interferences may predispose to Temporomandibular Pain Dysfunction Syndrome)

~ Deep traumatic overbite with palatal impingement of the mandibular incisors

~ Large overjets (increased risk of trauma), severe crowding (as this reduces periodontal support for teeth)

~ While severe malocclusion can have a psychologically debilitating effect, it is often influenced by social and cultural factors

Management

23.1.4. Fluorosis (Mottling)

Brown discolouration of teeth

Cause

~ Occurs due to long-term excess of fluoride. Endemic in areas of high fluoride occurring naturally in the water.

23.2.12. Osteomyelitis of the Jaw ICD10 CODE: M27.2

Inflammation of the medullary portion of the jaw bone which extends to involve the periosteum of the affected area. Infection in the bone ends up with pus formation in the medullary cavity or beneath the periosteum, and obstructs the blood supply. The infected bone becomes necrotic following ischaemia.

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

Initial stage

~ Malaise and fever; there is no swelling

~ Enlargement of regional lymphnodes

~ Teeth in affected area become painful and loose, thus causing difficulty in chewing

#### Investigations

Later stage

~ Bone undergoes  necrosis  and  area  becomes  very  painful  and swollen

~ Pus ruptures through the periosteum into the muscular and subcutaneous fascia. Eventually it is discharged on to the skin surface through a sinus

Investigations

 X-ray- Orthopantomograph (OPG) will show characteristic features (e.g., widening of periodontal spaces, changes in bone trabeculation, areas of radiolucency and sequestra formation in chronic stage)

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

Often presents as a tooth ache in the maxilla

Teeth are mobile

Extractions do not relieve the swelling

Peak incidence at 4-7 years of age and more common among boys

Classification

Burkitt's lymphoma is divided into 3 main clinical variants:

~ Endemic variant: occurs in malaria endemic areas. Chronic malaria is believed to reduce resistance to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is usually linked with the disease. The disease characteristically involves the jaw or other facial bone, distal ileum, caecum, ovaries, kidney, or the breast.

~ Sporadic type: (also known as ''non-African') is usually found outside of Africa

~ Immunodeficiency-associated Burkitt's lymphoma: usually associated with HIV infection or in post- transplant patients taking immunosuppressive drugs. Burkitt's lymphoma can be the initial manifestation of AIDS.

~ Large bowel obstructions: tumours, volvolus, adhesions, inflammatory strictures (e.g. diverticulosis, etc.)

#### Clinical features

Clinical features

~ Small  bowel  obstruction:  cramping  abdominal  pain,  nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention. Due to the accumulation of fuids into the dilated intestinal loops, there is usually a varying degree of dehydration

~ Large bowel obstruction: bloating, abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting and nausea less frequent and mainly in proximal colon obstruction; signs of dehydration and shock come later.

#### Investigations

Investigations

 Abdominal X-ray (erect or left lateral decubitus, for air- fluid level), see section 24.2.1 for details

#### Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis

~ Paralytic ileus (diffuse functional paralysis of small and large bowel due to drugs, biochemical abnormalities, abdominal infections etc)

Post-operative fluid therapy

Replace all fluid losses

Maintenance fluid

Use normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution and 5% dextrose  in  the  ratio  1:2  for  the  first  24-48 hours post-operatively

Monitor for adequate rehydration

Post-operative antibiotics and analgesics

 Continue with analgesics in the postoperative period. (Tramadol, pethidine, diclofenac, paracetamol; morphine may be used)

 Continue with antibiotic treatment where

clinically  indicated  (metronidazole  +  ceftriaxone +/- gentamycin)

In selective cases, non-operative treatment of intestinal obstruc- tion (in particular small bowel obstructions) can be tried

 Indicated in appendicular mass, acute pyosalpingitis (PID), some patients with adheisions, pseudo obstruction, plastic peritonitis of TB, acute pancreatitis

 Involves NGT decompression, intravenous fluid therapy and antibiotic therapy if indicated

 Monitor clinical progression of obstruction using param- eters of: abdominal pain, abdominal girth, amount and colour of NG aspirate, temperature, pulse

 If no improvement after 72 hours or the NG content becomes fecolent, operate the patient

#### Management

a serious medical emergency and the extent of severity depends on:

 Bleeding rate (hypovolaemic shock)

 Location of the bleeding (damage to organs, even with relatively limited amounts: see specific chapters)

Severe bleeding in a body cavity/space is an emergency condition with unstable vital signs (e.g., ruptured spleen, ruptured tubal pregnancy)

Management

24.1.3 Management of Medical Conditions in Surgical Patient

Principle

The medical condition must be stabilised as much as possible before surgery.

Pre-operative management

~ Establish whether condition is stable or unstable

~ If unstable, control or correct the condition



[TABLE]
TREATMENT
LOC
Invasive surgical intervention to control bleeding is life saving

Do not delay operation in attempt to stabilise the patient as this may not be achieved

Draw blood for grouping and cross matching for volume replacement after surgical haemostasis

Surgical intervention
-
Rapid sequence induction of general anaesthesia
-
Use drugs with minimal or no cardiac depression
-
Laparotomy to achieve surgical haemostasis
RR
[/TABLE]



#### TREATMENT

Operative and post-operative management

~ Anaesthesia technique based on condition and nature of surgery

~ Maintain the stable condition

TREATMENT

LOC

Hypertension

Diastolic of 90 mmHg and systolic of 140 mmHg are acceptable

If hypertension not adequately controlled, there  is  risk  of  vasoconstriction,  hypovolaemia, exaggerated vasoactive response to stress leading  to  hypo  or  hypertension,  hypertensive complications during anaesthesia

 Control hypertension pre-operatively

 Patient should take antihypertensive medicines on schedule even on the day of operation

 General anaesthesia technique is preferred

 Ensure adequate depth of anaesthesia and analgesia

Anaemia

Condition of reduced oxygen carrying capacity; patient prone to hypoxia

Heart failure may occur

Hypotension or hypoxia can cause cardiac arrest

 Correct anaemia to acceptable level depending on urgency of surgery (see section of anaemia 11.2.2)

 Regional anaesthesia is the preferred method

 If general anaesthesia is used, avoid myocardial depres- sant, e.g. thiopental

 Use small doses of anaesthetics

 Use high oxygen concentration

Intubate and ventilate except for very short procedures

HC4

TREATMENT

LOC

Replace blood very carefully

Extubate patient when fully awake

Give oxygen in the post-operative period

For sickle cell anaemia, the above also applies, as well as avoid- ing use of tourniquet

HC4

Asthma

 Avoid drugs and other factors likely to trigger bronchos- pasms, e.g., thiopental

 Regional anaesthesia is the preferred method

Diabetes

 Achieve blood glucose control using standard treatment pre-operatively

 If diabetic ketoacidosis:

Delay surgery even in emergency for 8-12 hours

Correct and control all associated disturbances

 Hyperglycaemia under general anaesthesia is safer than hypoglycaemia

 Patient should be operated on early in the morning and MUST be first on theatre list

 fRegional anaesthesia is the method of choice where applicable

Minor surgery

 Stop usual antidiabetic dose on the morning of surgery

 Start infusion of  5% glucose infusion rate of 2 ml/ minute in theatre

 Monitor blood sugar

 Usual medication is resumed as soon as the patient is able to take it orally

24.1.4 Newborn with Surgical Emergencies

Babies may be born at lower health facilities with congenital defects that require emergency surgical intervention at tertiary levels:

-The  common  surgical  emergencies  in  neonates  include: gastroschisis (defect of abdominal wall with intestine sticking outside  the  body),  tracheoesophageal  fistula,  imperforate anus, and spina bifida

-If diagnosed in lower level health facilities (HCII, HCIII, HCIV, District  Hospital),  apply  general  principles  of  supportive management of the newborn

 The aim should be to avoid hypothermia,  inimize risk of infection, ensure adequate hydration, and  inimize risk of aspiration and hypoglycaemia

### 24.1.5 Surgical Antibiotic Prophylaxis

24.1.5 Surgical Antibiotic Prophylaxis

This is the pre-operative administration of antibiotics to reduce the risk of surgical site infection.

General principles

~ The need of prophylaxis depends on the nature of the expected wound

-Wounds that are expected to be clean (no inflammation,

-And  respiratory,  genital,  urinary  and  alimentary  tract  not entered)  generally  DO  NOT  require  prophylaxis  except where the consequences of surgical site infection could be severe (e.g., joint replacements)

-Prophylaxis  is  indicated  in  cases  of  clean-contaminated wounds (entering respiratory, genital, urinary and alimentary tracts but no unusual contamination)

-Treatment with a course of antibiotics is indicated in

-procedures with contaminated wounds (fresh open accidental wounds, operations with major breaks in sterile techniques), dirty or infected wounds (old traumatic wounds with retained necrotic tissue, clinical infection, perforated viscera)

~ Prophylaxis is given <60 minutes before the first incision

~ Refer to institution-specific protocols for details

24.2 DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING

### 24.2.1 Diagnostic Imaging: A Clinical Perspective

Prophylaxis is not recommended for most uncomplicated clean procedures

One single dose prior to the procedure is usually sufficient

Routine post-operative antimicrobial administration is NOT recommended for most surgeries as it causes wastage of limited resources, causes unnecessary side effects to the patient and can lead to antimicrobial resistance.

24.2.1 Diagnostic Imaging: A Clinical Perspective

Medical imaging is an essential part of the diagnosis of many diseases.

A diagnostic imaging procedure is indicated when the management of a patient depends on the findings of the procedure. Therefore, before any diagnostic imaging procedure is requested, the question of how the results will influence patient management and care should always be asked.

~ Prior to requesting a procedure, it is useful to determine if the required information is already available from recent procedures, and if the relevant clinical, laboratory, diagnostic imaging, and treatment information is provided.

~ When  indicated  and  available,  alternative  diagnostic  imaging procedures which do not use ionising radiation, e.g. ultrasound, should be chosen first, especially in children.

Questions to be answered to prevent unnecessary use of procedure and radiation

~ Has this procedure been done already?

~ Does the patient need it?

~ Does the patient need it NOW?

~ Is this the best procedure?

~ Are all the investigations I am requesting necessary?

~ Have you provided  appropriate  clinical  information  and  questions that the procedure should answer?

No procedure should ever be requested in lieu of a thorough clinical assessment or as a means of satisfying a difficult patient.

Basic Diagnostic Imaging Modalities

 Plain Radiography (Hospital)

 Ultrasound scan (HC4 and Hospital)

-Ultrasound is non-invasive and does not use ionising radiation. Therefore, when indicated, it is the most appropriate imaging modality for children and pregnant women.

Other imaging modalities (at RR and NR)

~ Computed tomography

~ Fluoroscopy

~ Magnetic Resonance Imaging

~ Nuclear Medicine

~ Mammography

In the following table, a summary of the clinical indication, the suggest- ed investigation modality and the possible findings are presented, as a guide to request the correct investigation based on the clinical suspicion.

Note

Types of Anaesthesia

Anaesthesia may be produced in a number of ways

General anaesthesia

~ Basic elements: Loss of consciousness, analgesia, prevention of undesirable reflexes, and muscle relaxation

Regional or local anaesthesia

~ Sensation of pain is blocked without loss of consciousness. The conduction of stimulus from a painful site to the brain can be interrupted at one of the many points:



[TABLE]
Body Part Affected
Features
Before anaesthesia
~ Anaesthesia is administered (induction and maintenance) ~ The patient must be monitored meticu- lously to: ~ Ensure his/her well-being ~ Detect dangerous signs as soon as they arise and appropriately treat them ~ Expertise in resuscitation is obligatory. If in trouble, ask for help ~ Keep an accurate and legible record of the anaesthetic and all measured vital signs on
After anaesthesia
~ The patient: - Recovers from effects of anaesthesia - Has stable vital signs - Is returned to the ward in the fully conscious state ~ Follow-up patient for next 24 hours

PREPARATION IN THE OPERATING THEATRE

PRE-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

The aim is to make the patient as fit as possible before surgical operation

Assessment of the patient

-Identify the patient and establish rapport

-A standard history is obtained and an examination done

-Emphasis is on the cardio-respiratory systems

-Investigations appropriately interpreted e.g., Hb

-Health status/condition of the patient

-Classify physical status of the patient according to A.S.A. (ASA classification 1-5 with or without E)

-Make  a  plan  for  anaesthesia  based  on  the  information obtained

Preparation of the patient

-Explain the procedure to the patient and ensure that he/ she has understood

-Ensure informed consent form is signed

-Weight of patient should be taken

-Check site and side of the operation

-Check period of fasting

-Remove: Ornaments/prostheses/dentures that may injure the patient and make-up that may interfere with monitoring

-Any  other necessary preparation based on  patient's condition and nature of the operation (condition of deficits/ imbalances should be corrected, control chronic conditions)

-Ability of the patient to withstand the stresses and adverse effects  of  anaesthesia  and  the  surgical  procedure  will depend on how well prepared he/she is

24.3.1.2 General Anaesthetic Agents

Intravenous agents

Most anaesthetic agents are included in the specialist essential medicines list meaning that use is restricted to specialised health workers

### 24.3.3 Selection of Type of Anaesthesia for the Patient

24.3.1.3 Muscle Relaxants

They are used to provide muscle relaxation to facilitate a procedure, and used in a patient who is unconscious, e.g. general anaesthesia, or sedated.

~ Precaution before using a muscle relaxant: always have means of supporting the airway and respiration

24.3.3 Selection of Type of Anaesthesia for the Patient

Consider the following factors:

~ Patient  factors:  medical  state,  time  of  last  meal,  mental  state, wish of patient if applicable

~ Surgical factors: nature of surgery, site of operation, estimated duration of surgery, position in which the surgery is to be performed

~ Anaesthetic factors: availability of drugs, experience and competence of the anaesthetic provider

24.3.3.1 Techniques of General Anaesthesia

Requirements for all

-Take and record baseline vital signs

-Establish intravenous line and commence infusion

[TABLE]
MEDICINE
CHARACTERISTICS AND USE
Halothane
~ Precaution: Always use at least 30% oxy- gen with halothane ~ It is safe to avoid use of adrenaline to pre- vent high incidence of arrhythmias ~ Adverse effects which may occur include: - Atony of the gravid uterus - Post-operative shivering - Severe cardiopulmonary depression
[/TABLE]

RAPID SEQUENCE INDUCTION OF GENERAL ANAESTHESIA

Induce anaesthesia by:

~ Intravenous route (adults) or

~ Inhalation route (children, patient with difficult airway)

Maintenance

~ Secure a clear airway using an oropharyngeal airway

~ The mask is placed on the face

~ Titrate concentration of inhalation against response of the patient

~ Monitor, record every 5 minutes or more frequently, BP, pulse, respiration, colour, oximetry

Indication

~ This technique may be used for operations on limbs, perineum, superficial wall of chest, and abdomen

~ Suitable for operations lasting less than 30 minutes

Induce anaesthesia:

~ Intravenous/inhalation (see above)

~ Tracheal intubation

-When  spontaneously  breathing  for  anticipated  difficult airway (for children) or

-Under relaxation by suxamethonium and laryngoscopy

-Confirm  correct  tube  placement  by  presence  of  breath sounds on both chest sides

-Connect the breathing/delivery system to the endotracheal tube

Maintenance

~ Titrate concentration of inhalation agent against response of the patient

-A selected, long acting muscle relaxant is given

-Intermittent positive pressure ventilation is done

RAPID SEQUENCE INDUCTION OF GENERAL ANAESTHESIA

Monitor vital signs (as above)

~ At the end of the operation when the patient shows signs of respiratory effort, give

IV. Neostigmine 0.03 to 0.07 mg/kg to reverse the

effects of the long acting muscle relaxant

Indication

~ All operations that require a protected airway and controlled ventilation, e.g, intraabdominal, intrathoracic, and intracranial operations

(Also called crash induction) For patients with 'full stomach' and at risk of regurgitation, e.g., emergency surgery, distended abdomen

Crash induction steps

~ Establish an intravenous line and commence infusions

~ Preoxygenation for >3 minutes

~ Induce with selected intravenous anaesthetic agent

~ Assistant applies cricoid pressure

~ IV suxamethonium is given

~ Laryngosopy is done

~ Trachea is intubated and correct tube placement confirmed

~ The cuff of the endotracheal tube is inflated, then cricoid pres- sure released

~ The position of the tube is fixed by strapping and an airway is inserted

~ Then connect to breathing circuit/system to maintain anaes- thesia

24.1.1.1 Techniques for Regional Anaesthesia

~ Detailed knowledge of anatomy, technique, and possible complications is important for correct injection placement

~ Preoperative assessment and preparation of the patient should be done

~ Patient refusal and local sepsis are the only absolute contraindications

~ Select the appropriate technique for operation

PROCEDURE

~ Discuss the procedure with the patient

~ Identify the injection site using appropriate landmarks

~ Observe aseptic conditions

~ Use small bore needle, which causes less pain during injection

~ Select concentration and volume of drug according to the tech- nique

~ Aspirate before injection to avoid accidental intravascular in- jection

~ Inject slowly and allow 5-10 minutes for onset of drug action

~ Confirm desired block effect before surgery commences

~ The patient must be monitored throughout the procedure

Note



Supplemental agents should be available for analgesia or anaes- thesia if technique is inadequate



Resuscitative equipment, drugs, and oxygen must be at hand before administration of any anaesthetic

Standard Infection Control Precautions

Transmission of infections in health care facilities can be prevented and controlled through the application of basic infection control precautions which can be grouped into:

~ Standard  precautions:  basic  infection  control  measures  which must be applied to all patients at all times, regardless of diagnosis or infectious status. They are designed to reduce the risk of  transmission  of  micro-organisms  from  both  recognized  and non-recognized sources.

~ Additional  (transmission-based)  precautions:  measures  that  are used for patients known or suspected to be infected or colonized with  highly  transmissible  or  epidemiological  important  pathogens  for  which  additional  precautions  are  needed  to  interrupt transmission in health care facilities.

For more details please refer to Uganda National Infection Prevention and Control Guidelines December 2013.

Standard Precautions

Hygiene

Personal hygiene

Personal Hygiene involves the general cleanliness and care of the whole body: short and clean nails, short or pinned up hair, appropriate clean clothing (uniforms), no jewels on the hands, closed shoes.

Hand washing

Hand washing is a major component of standard precautions and one of the most effective methods to prevent transmission of pathogens associated with health care.

WASH YOUR HANDS

THOROUGHLY WITH SOAP

AND WATER OR USE A SUITABLE DISINFECTANT

 Before and after any direct patient contact and between patients

 When any skin area is contaminated with body fluids

 Before handling an invasive device or doing any procedures (even if gloves will be worn!)

 After removing gloves

 During patient care, when moving from contaminated to a clean body site of the patient

 After contact with inanimate objects in the immediate

 vicinity of the patient.

~ Hand wash (40-60 sec) with water and soap, rub all surfacs, dry with a single use towel or

~ Hand rub (wtih an alcohol based rub) for 20-30 sec, apply enough product to cover all areas of the hands and rub hands until dry

Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette

~ Patients  with  respiratory  symptoms  should  cover  their  mouth and nose with tissue or mask while coughing/ sneezing, dispose of used tissues and masks and perform hand hygiene after con- tact with respiratory secretions

~ Patients  with  respiratory  symptoms  should  be  placed  1  metre away from others in waiting areas and hand hygiene, tissues and masks made available in common areas

Instrument hygiene (decontamination)

Decontamination is the combination of processes, including cleaning,

disinfection and/or sterilisation used to render a re- useable medical device safe for further episodes of use. The level of decontamination depends on the situation involved and the type and use of equipment.

~ Cleaning  is  the  single  most  important  step  in  making  a  medicaldevicereadyforre-use:byremovingorganicmaterial  and  reducing  the  number  of  micro-organisms  present,  it  is  an  essential prerequisite  of  equipment  decontamination  to  ensure  effective disinfection  or  sterilization  can  be  subsequently  carried  out.  It utilizes detergents.

~ Disinfection 'is a process used to reduce the number of viable micro-organisms, which may not necessarily inactivate some viruses and bacterial spores. Disinfection will not achieve the same reduction in microbial contamination levels as sterilization. It can be carried out by heat (boiling) or by chemical disinfectants.

~ Sterilization is a process used to render the object free from viable micro-organisms, including spores and viruses. Moist Heat via clean steam (autoclaving) is the method of choice. Chemical disinfection may only be used when autoclaving is not possible.

Facility hygiene

A clean environment forms the basis of sound infection prevention and control practices. This is because there is an important link between cleaning of health care facilities and persistence of nosocomial pathogens.

~ The  purpose  of  cleaning  the  environment  is  toremove  visible dirt, reduce the level of microorganisms and to minimize the dissemination of infectious agents in the facility, thereby providing an aesthetically pleasing, sanitary and relatively contamination -free environment for patients, staff and visitors

Linen and laundry

~ Ensure proper handling of linen/laundry

 Collect clothing/sheets stained with blood/body-fluids while wearing gloves or using a plastic bag and keep separate from other laundry - never touch them directly

 Disinfect with hypochlorite if contaminated with body fluids

 Wash with soap and boil for 20 minutes

Personal Protective equipment (PPE)

Personal Protective Equipment is specialised clothing or equipment worn to protect someone against a hazard or infection. PPE is indicated when health worker-patient interaction indicates that exposure to blood or body fluids is anticipated. They provide a physical barrier between micro- organism and the person.

Gloves

~ Wear clean protective  gloves  when  handling  body  fluids/secretions,  mucous  membranes,  nonintact  skin  contaminated  waste,soiled bedding or linen instruments, and for when cleaning body fluid spills

~ Change between tasks and procedures on the same patients after contact with potentially infectious material

~ Remove after use, before touching any other surface, and wash hands immediately

~ Wear  sterile  or  high-level  disinfected  gloves  when  performing sterile procedures

Other PPE

~ Wear a surgical or procedure mask and eye protection (googles or glasses) or a face shield when performing activities which are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions

~ Wear a gown to protect skin and prevent soiling of clothing in activities as above

~ Use a waterproof bandage to cover wounds

~ Wear protective boots and gloves and where possible, wear a water-proof apron when working in a heavily contaminated area, e.g., toilets

~ Avoid  mouth-to-mouth  resuscitation  and  pipetting  by  mouth where possible

~ In surgical procedures, use a needle holder and appropriate sized needle, wear double gloves and eye shield

Safe handling of sharps

~ Ensure safe sharps handling and disposal

~ Avoid  accidental  pricks  and  cuts  with  contaminated  sharp  instruments (e.g., needles) by careful handling and proper disposal

~ Use 'hands-free' technique for passing sharp instruments

~ Keep a puncture-resistant container nearby

~ Use safe injection practices:

-Use a sterile needle and syringe for every injection

-Do not recap, bend, or break needles after use

~ Drop all  used  disposable  needles,  plastic  syringes,  and  blades directly into the sharps container without recapping or passing to another person

~ Empty or send for incineration when container is full

Safe waste disposal

~ Separate hazardous (potentially dangerous) from non- hazardous (routine) waste

-Hazardous  waste  includes:  infectious  waste  (e.g. soiled bandages), anatomical waste (placenta), sharps, chemical and pharmaceutical waste

~ Use  adequate  personal  protective  equipment  when  handling hazardous waste (boots, gown, water proof apron, gloves, face protection)

~ Practice safe waste disposal as per guidelines (incineration, burying)

Additional Precautions

These are necessary for patients who are known or suspected to be

infected or colonized with specific pathogens that are transmitted by airborn, droplet or contact route of transmission.

Airborn precautions

Airborn precautions are designed to prevent transmission of particles < 5 micron in size (e.g. some viruses like measles or chickenpox, M. tubeculosis)

~ Placement of a patient in a well ventilated room with door closed and discharge of air outdoors

~ Use of appropriate respirators (masks with high filtration power) when entering the room

~ Limitation of contacts (visitors)

~ Use of surgical mask for the patient if leaving the room

~ Adherence to cough etiquette by the patient

~ In particular settings, negative air pressure an be created

Droplet precautions

They are designed to prevent transmission of pathogens transmitted by droplets, released by talking, sneezing and coughing: H. Influenza, N.meningitis, some viruses, pertussis, influenza etc.

~ Place patient in well ventilated room or at least 1 metre distance from other patients

~ Wear a mask if within 1 metre from the patient

~ Patient to wear a mask when moving.

 Closed door and negatve air pressure are not necessary

Contact precautions

These precautions are designed to reduce the transmission of organism from an infected or colonized patient through direct or indirect contact. It applies to microorganisms like HIV, hepatitis B, multi-drug resistant

bacteria like MRSA, herpes simplex, varicella and haemorrhagic fevers viruses, skin staphylococcal infections, scabies, lice, other wound infections.

~ Appropriate barrier method must be used

~ Isolate patient, use dedicated equipment if possible

~ Wear gloves before entering the room, change gloves after contact with potentially infected material

~ Remove gloves as soon as leaving the room and wash hands with an antimicrobial

~ Wear a gown if necessary

~ Minimize patient's movements outside the room

In case of blood borne pathogens (HIV, hepatitis B)

~ Use particular precautions in taking blood samples

~ Decontaminate any body fluid/blood spillage with 0.5/1% hypochlorite solutions

Patients suspected of having hemorrhagic fevers require the strictest infection control procedures (see WHO, 2016. Clinical management of patients with viral hemorrhagic fever. http://www.who.int/csr/resources/ publications/clinical- management-patients/en/)

Post-Exposure Prophylaxis

Accidental exposure to blood during medical procedures (needle or other sharp injury, splashes of blood on mucosae) carries the risk of transmission of HIV and/or hepatitis B.

Immunization against hepatitis B is recommended in health workers as an effective protection measure.

Steps for post exposure prophylaxis are described in section 3.1.11.1

Appendix 2

Pharmacovigilance and Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting

Pharmacovigilance and Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting

Pharmacovigilance is defined as the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other drug-related problem.

The aims of pharmacovigilance are to enhance patient care and patient safety in relation to the use of medicines; and to support public health programmes by providing reliable, balanced information for the effective assessment of the risk- benefit profile of medicines.

Any medicine may cause unwanted or unexpected adverse reactions, some of which may be life threatening, for example anaphylactic shock or liver failure.

Why Should You Report?

Rapid detection and recording of adverse drug reactions (ADR) is of vital importance so that unrecognised hazards are identified promptly and appropriate regulatory action is taken to ensure medicines are used safely and future events are prevented.

What Should Be Reported

Suspected adverse events to any  medicine,  vaccines  and herbal products should be reported (including self- medication medicines).

Report all adverse drug reactions such as:

~ ADRs to to any medicine (whether new or old)

~ Serious reactions and interactions

~ ADRs which are not clearly stated in the package insert

~ Unusual or interesting adverse drug reactions

~ All adverse reactions or poisonings to traditional or herbal remedies

Report Product Quality Problems such as:

~ Suspected contamination

~ Questionable stability

~ Defective components

~ Poor packaging or labelling

~ Therapeutic failures

~ Non-adherence (may be due to product characteristic)

Report medication errors such as:

~ Prescribing errors

~ Dispensing errors

~ Medicine preparation error

~ Administration errors

~ Monitoring error

Who should report?

~ All health workers

~ Patients

~ Any member of the public

~ Medical representatives

~ Pharmaceutical Companies, Distributors, Wholesalers and Retailers

Where and How to Report

Health workers are urged  to  immediately  report  suspected ADRs directly to the National Drug Authority Pharmacovigilance Centre using the ADR forms (see example at the end of this section). The forms can

also be obtained from the regional pharmacovigilance centres. Encourage your patients to report suspected ADRs to you.

ADRs can also be reported directly online using the following links:

~ www.nda.or.ug

~ https://primaryreporting.who-umc.org/Reporting/ Reporter?OrganizationID=UG

~ All regional referral hospitals have pharmacovigilance coordinators

~ NDA regional offices

What Will Happen When I Report?

When NDA receives your report, they will assess the likelihood that the suspected adverse reaction is actually due to the medicine, using the WHO causality assessment criteria for deciding on the contribution of the medicine towards the adverse event.

Depending on the outcome of the causality assessment, NDA will give feedback in any of the following ways: medicine alerts, media statements, patient information leaflets, newsletters and personal feedback to reporters.

Prevention of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)

~ Never use any medicine without a clear indication

~ If a patient is pregnant, do not use a medicine unless it is absolutely necessary

~ Ask  the  patient  if  they  have  any  allergies,  hypersensitivity  or previous reactions to the medicine or to similar medicines

~ Reduce doses when necessary, for example, in the young, the elderly, and if liver or renal disease is present

~ Always prescribe as few medicines as possible

~ Carefully explain dose regimes to patients, especially those on multiple medicines, the elderly, and anyone likely to misunderstand. Check for understanding before patient goes away.

~ Age and liver or kidney disease may affect the way medicines behave in the body so that smaller than usual amounts are needed

~ Ask if patient is taking other medicines including self medication medicines, health supplements, herbal products as interactions can occur

~ If possible, always use medicines with which you are familiar

~ Look out for ADRs when using new or unfamiliar drugs

~ Warn patients about likely adverse effects and advise them on what to do if they occur

~ Give patients on certain prolonged treatments, for example anticoagulants, corticosteroids, and insulin, a small card which they can carry with them giving information about the treatment

Note: Please attach additional pages to the ADR reporting form if necessary. Even if you do not know some details in the form, do not be put off reporting the suspected adverse event

Appendix 3

National Laboratory Test Menu

The test menu was developed by Ministry of Health/Uganda National Health Laboratory Services (UNHLS). It is a list of tests that are available at the specified level of health care. The laboratory system of Uganda is designed to support the minimum health care package for each level of care, with complexity of tests increasing with the level of care.

The laboratory test menu has been included in UCG 2023, in order to guide clinicians about the laboratory services available at each level of health care, and where to refer a patient in need of a particular test.
